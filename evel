‚úÖ Successes and Achievements

In 2025, I delivered across a wide range of high-impact transactions, strategic initiatives, and internal leadership responsibilities ‚Äî all contributing meaningfully to the continued growth of the i-ABF platform and Wells Fargo‚Äôs broader CIB franchise.

Key highlights include:
	‚Ä¢	Execution of flagship mandates: I led the execution of POUK2025‚Äë1, our largest bilateral auto ABS to date, and the first UK public auto ABS transaction since 2022, both for a top-five global strategic client. The public deal was launched in a cautious post-scandal environment, ultimately upsized by 50% with no investor drop-off, and both tranches priced at the tight end of guidance. These transactions demonstrated the strength of our integrated platform ‚Äî combining balance sheet support, derivative monetisation, and capital markets execution.
	‚Ä¢	EMEA franchise expansion: I executed Project Anaheim, our first EMEA private warehouse with a sponsor client, combining Markets and SPG capabilities. I also originated and supported a broad range of new mandates, including a dealer floorplan facility for the largest used-car platform in Europe, Polaris 2025‚Äë3, and receivables-backed financings (e.g. mobile handsets). These reflect our strategic push to diversify across asset types, sectors, and sponsors.
	‚Ä¢	One-CIB delivery: I worked closely with the Derivatives desk and US Modelling team on the successful structuring and delivery of our largest private auto warehouse to date. The result was a multi-product, cross-LOB solution that generated both asset-level margin and additional fee revenue ‚Äî exemplifying the One-CIB approach.
	‚Ä¢	Client trust and repeat mandates: The quality of delivery translated into tangible relationship wins, including being selected by a Top Markets client to refinance 3 out of 3 of their mortgage portfolios in Ireland, reinforcing our reputation as a trusted and consistent long-term partner.
	‚Ä¢	Franchise development and culture building: Beyond deal work, I took an active role in hiring, mentorship, onboarding, and training. I represented Markets at university Open House events, mentored our first intern through structured deliverables (who accepted a return offer), and ran multiple training sessions for new joiners. I also led internal improvements in tool development and reporting, freeing up team capacity and contributing to platform scalability.

üî≠ Areas of Focus

Looking ahead, my key areas of focus are:
	1.	Deepening Origination Leadership
Continue expanding front-to-back ownership on live transactions, with a focus on sponsor-led private and public mandates. Further embed myself in idea generation and pitch delivery, especially in underpenetrated asset types (e.g. consumer finance, embedded finance) and jurisdictions (e.g. Central Europe).
	2.	Multi-Product Connectivity
Enhance my ability to originate and structure across the full Wells Fargo platform, not just balance sheet-led structures. This includes earlier engagement with derivatives, FX, and syndicate to maximise fee opportunities and deepen client penetration.
	3.	Platform and Talent Development
Scale internal capabilities by documenting processes, standardising PM tooling, and mentoring junior colleagues into greater execution ownership. Help foster a resilient, well-rounded team with the right mix of technical depth and commercial acumen.
	4.	Client Franchise Building
Leverage relationship momentum with strategic clients to originate repeat mandates and become a go-to point of contact for European structured lending needs, aligning with Wells Fargo‚Äôs vision of being a trusted global partner.

üõ°Ô∏è Risk Overlay

Risk management remained a core pillar of my 2025 contributions, with a continued focus on proactive issue identification, rapid escalation, and robust internal controls.

Key highlights include:
	‚Ä¢	Project Mareva risk remediation: Successfully converted a complex transaction from security format to loan format. This required coordination across multiple stakeholders (LoanOps, Treasury, Middle Office, Market Risk, OTC Settlements, Finance) and delivered material operational risk reduction by eliminating the need for FAS133 hedge accounting, AFS exposure, and associated reporting (MTM, WAL, CCAR).
	‚Ä¢	Booking and regulatory integrity: Identified and resolved multiple booking and reporting issues, including SONIA-linked LoanIQ errors and Basel/revenue misstatements. Supported the US RegTeam with SSFA walkthroughs for private ABS and became the main point of contact for quarterly Basel inputs from our side.
	‚Ä¢	Policy contribution and documentation: Participated in drafting enhancements to MFG credit policy and led the standardisation of key internal documentation and guidance materials. This strengthened our infrastructure and improved team resilience in risk-sensitive functions.
	‚Ä¢	Internal risk process streamlining: Delegated routine reporting and enhanced task ownership across the team, ensuring continuity while reducing manual processing risk and enhancing audit-readiness.

These efforts contributed directly to our objectives of operating with a risk mindset, reducing control breaks, and building a more robust and scalable risk framework across the platform.

üìå Overall Summary

2025 has been a year of both growth and consolidation ‚Äî building on the momentum of previous years and taking a clear step up following my promotion to Executive Director. I contributed across high-profile transactions, new product initiatives, and internal team development, while maintaining strong ownership of risk, governance, and execution quality.

The volume, complexity, and diversity of mandates I‚Äôve worked on reflect increasing trust from clients and internal stakeholders alike. I‚Äôve helped drive strategic mandates, originated new business, enhanced our internal controls, and mentored the next generation of talent ‚Äî all while reinforcing Wells Fargo‚Äôs reputation as a reliable, solution-driven partner.

Looking ahead to H2 and beyond, my focus is on further embedding our franchise into key client workflows, enhancing internal execution capacity, and continuing to build a high-performing team culture that is client-centric, risk-aware, and commercially aligned.

‚úÖ Custom Instructions ‚Äî Optimised for a Structured-Finance Investment Banker

1. What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?

I am an Executive Director working in the Structured Finance / Securitised Products Group of a major investment bank in London.
My work spans the full life-cycle of EMEA securitisation and structured-lending transactions ‚Äî including warehouse financing, public ABS (RMBS, Auto, Consumer, CMBS, etc.), and private bilateral deals.

My role combines:
	‚Ä¢	Credit analysis: loan pool stratification, PD/LGD modelling, collateral performance analytics.
	‚Ä¢	Structuring & modelling: waterfall mechanics, OC/CE build-ups, WAFF/WALS calculations, and tranche sizing.
	‚Ä¢	Legal & regulatory review: transaction documents, risk-retention, Article 7 reporting, rating-agency criteria (S&P, Fitch, Moody‚Äôs, DBRS, KBRA).
	‚Ä¢	Execution: deal timelines, investor materials, term sheets, and capital-markets coordination.

I often need precise, concise, and technical explanations, as well as templates, Excel/VBA/Python code, and professional-grade drafting (emails, memos, and slides).
I value analytical depth, sceptical reasoning, and clarity ‚Äî not generic or high-level summaries.

‚∏ª

2. How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

Respond as an expert securitisation banker and data analyst ‚Äî technically fluent, sceptical, and grounded in EMEA market practice.
Prioritise precision, logical reasoning, and real-world applicability.

When producing outputs:
	‚Ä¢	Use structured formatting (tables, bullet points, numbered sections).
	‚Ä¢	Be explicit about formulas, assumptions, and dependencies.
	‚Ä¢	Default to EMEA standards (UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Where helpful, show Excel formulas, VBA snippets, or Python examples consistent with MS365 and enterprise compliance.
	‚Ä¢	For legal drafting, emulate the tone of transaction documentation or formal correspondence.
	‚Ä¢	For presentations, match the concise, data-driven tone of internal pitch decks and investor reports.
	‚Ä¢	For regulatory or rating-agency analysis, cite criteria and show how metrics are derived.

When uncertain, state what assumptions you are making ‚Äî don‚Äôt speculate or simplify excessively.
