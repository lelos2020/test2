Sure — here’s a tight, professional-grade credit memo paragraph you can drop directly into a committee paper or transaction summary.
It’s written from a senior lender perspective and aligned with how Auto1 operates during the revolving period under the 7th Amendment.

📄 Credit Memo – Transaction Operations (Revolving Period)

During the revolving period, the facility operates as a fully secured, daily-monitored inventory financing platform supporting Auto1 Group SE’s vehicle trading activities.  The Issuer (Auto1 Funding B.V.) issues Senior, Mezzanine and Junior Notes and on-lends proceeds to Auto1 European Cars B.V. (“CarCo”) to fund the purchase of eligible vehicles.  CarCo acts as borrower, servicer and collateral owner, with all sale proceeds from financed vehicles swept daily into pledged collection accounts held under the control of Crédit Agricole CIB (Agent and Security Trustee).  Drawdowns are governed by a dynamic Borrowing-Base test referencing eligible inventory value, and any deficiencies are required to be cured within five business days.  Principal collections from vehicle disposals are ordinarily re-advanced to fund new eligible purchases, preserving revolving status until the scheduled revolving end date or an early-amortisation trigger.  Liquidity and operational resilience are supported through fully-funded reserve accounts (≈2% of outstanding balances) and a comprehensive security package over all assets, accounts and intercompany receivables.  This construct provides transparent collateral coverage, daily cash-flow visibility and strong structural controls consistent with senior secured warehouse standards.
