📄 Credit Memo – Transaction Operations (Revolving Period)

During the revolving period, the facility operates as a fully secured, daily-monitored inventory financing platform supporting Auto1 Group SE’s vehicle trading activities.  The Issuer (Auto1 Funding B.V.) issues Senior, Mezzanine and Junior Notes and on-lends proceeds to Auto1 European Cars B.V. (“CarCo”) to fund the purchase of eligible vehicles.  CarCo acts as borrower, servicer and collateral owner, with all sale proceeds from financed vehicles swept daily into pledged collection accounts held under the control of Crédit Agricole CIB (Agent and Security Trustee).  Drawdowns are governed by a dynamic Borrowing-Base test referencing eligible inventory value, and any deficiencies are required to be cured within five business days.  Principal collections from vehicle disposals are ordinarily re-advanced to fund new eligible purchases, preserving revolving status until the scheduled revolving end date or an early-amortisation trigger.  Liquidity and operational resilience are supported through fully-funded reserve accounts (≈2% of outstanding balances) and a comprehensive security package over all assets, accounts and intercompany receivables.  This construct provides transparent collateral coverage, daily cash-flow visibility and strong structural controls consistent with senior secured warehouse standards.


Certainly — here’s a concise, credit-committee–ready section describing the credit enhancement structure of the Auto1 Inventory ABS under the 7th Amendment.

📄 Credit Enhancement

Credit enhancement (“CE”) in the Auto1 Inventory Facility is provided through a combination of structural subordination, overcollateralisation, and liquidity reserves, ensuring the Senior Notes are protected from losses arising from asset under-performance or timing mismatches.  The transaction employs a three-tier capital structure—Senior, Mezzanine and Junior tranches—funded through inter-company loans from the Issuer to CarCo, with full subordination of Mezzanine and Junior amounts to the Senior facility both in the payment waterfall and in enforcement.

At the collateral level, the facility maintains dynamic overcollateralisation through the Borrowing-Base mechanism.  The aggregate principal advanced under the Senior and Mezzanine loans may not exceed the Net Borrowing Base, defined as the lower of (i) the aggregate value of eligible vehicles, adjusted for haircuts, and (ii) concentration-limited exposures net of reserves.  This ensures continuous asset coverage and automatically traps excess proceeds as the portfolio seasonally fluctuates.  Any Borrowing-Base deficiency must be cured within five business days through cash repayment, vehicle substitution, or Auto1 corporate top-up, thereby preventing structural erosion of enhancement.

Further CE is provided via liquidity and reserve accounts.  The Issuer Liquidity Reserve (1.0% of Senior Notes) and the CarCo Liquidity Reserve (0.75% of total loans) ensure timely payment of interest and senior fees under stress scenarios, while a dedicated Tax and Operating Reserve (0.25%) covers non-credit operational outflows.  Collections are swept daily to pledged accounts under the control of Crédit Agricole CIB, eliminating commingling exposure and ensuring rapid deleveraging upon trigger events.  The transaction is also supported by a corporate undertaking from Auto1 Group SE, which can fund temporary shortfalls or cure Borrowing-Base breaches.

Collectively, these layers—subordination, dynamic overcollateralisation, daily cash control, and funded reserves—provide a robust multi-channel enhancement framework that protects the Senior facility from both credit and liquidity shocks, aligning the structure with investment-grade securitisation standards.
