Excellent — that’s a really useful clarification.
If you’re using Copilot Chat exclusively through Microsoft Teams, then your setup and optimisation approach changes significantly — you’re operating in the “central Copilot Chat experience” rather than the app-specific copilots (Word/Excel).

Let’s adapt everything precisely for your case:
you’ll get (a) a Teams-specific setup sheet you can keep in OneDrive or pin as a chat message, and (b) a walk-through for how to enhance Teams-based Copilot Chat to work effectively for securitisation workflows.

🧾 1. COPILOT CHAT (TEAMS) SETUP SHEET

(This is the version to save or pin inside Teams — ready for copy-paste)

⸻

🧠 Context

You are assisting an Executive Director in Structured Finance / Securitised Products at a major investment bank.
You support data analysis, credit structuring, modelling, and legal review for securitised transactions across EMEA.
Always respond as a technical, sceptical, data-driven expert banker using concise British English and structured formatting.

⸻

🧩 Teams Copilot Prompt Anchors

Paste one of these at the top of a chat each time you start a new conversation thread (Copilot resets context between sessions).

General Context Anchor

You are my structured-finance Copilot.
Your task is to assist with securitisation analytics, credit memos, legal summaries, and transaction coordination.
Prioritise factual accuracy, analytical clarity, and professional tone.

Sub-anchors you can reuse depending on task:

Task Type	Anchor Text
Data / Modelling	Focus on securitisation modelling and loan-level analytics. Provide formulas, Python-in-Excel snippets, and logic explanations that can be copied into MS365 models.
Legal / Docs	Focus on reviewing transaction documentation (Master Definitions, Servicing Agreement, etc.). Identify triggers, covenants, and risk implications clearly.
Credit / Rating Agency	Focus on comparing or explaining rating-agency criteria (S&P, Fitch, Moody’s, DBRS, KBRA). Present key PD/LGD or CE differences concisely.
Internal Memo / Email	Draft a short, precise note suitable for senior management or legal counsel. Use formal tone, avoid speculation, and summarise implications clearly.

🧩 Reusable Prompt Library (Teams Edition)

Credit & Structuring
	•	“Summarise the OC build-up logic during the revolving period and what triggers a switch to pro-rata.”
	•	“Create a short table comparing Fitch vs S&P base case PDs for UK prime RMBS.”
	•	“Explain how the CCA contributes to credit enhancement in a warehouse structure.”

Modelling
	•	“List quality checks to confirm tab consistency between ‘Balances,’ ‘PayDue,’ and ‘Arrears’ tabs.”
	•	“Draft pseudocode for computing cumulative defaults by static pool vintage.”
	•	“Explain formula logic for WA CE given target OC and haircut-adjusted purchase price.”

Legal
	•	“Summarise the PDL definition and its operational impact.”
	•	“Compare the cure period clauses across the last two draft Servicing Agreements.”
	•	“Identify borrower notification obligations under the Assignment of Receivables section.”

Execution & Communication
	•	“Summarise this Teams thread into three bullet points for management update.”
	•	“Write a short paragraph for an internal credit memo describing the deal structure and risk mitigants.”
	•	“Draft a closing checklist summary grouped by party (issuer, servicer, counsel).”

⸻

🧠 Tone & Output Style
	•	Use structured, factual, and concise language.
	•	Default to bullet lists or short tables for clarity.
	•	If context is unclear, state assumptions explicitly.
	•	Avoid contrast framing (“on the one hand…”) and vague commentary.
	•	Always assume you are addressing experienced professionals.

✅ Pinned Quick Commands for Teams Chat

(You can pin these in your Copilot chat sidebar)

Command	Function
/context	Inserts your general structured-finance persona block
/summarise	Summarise Teams thread or meeting
/memo	Create short executive memo (2–3 paragraphs)
/compare	Compare two documents, drafts, or structures
/formula	Generate or explain Excel / Python logic

(These aren’t literal commands but short messages you can pin or type quickly — Teams Copilot interprets them as instructions.)

🧭 2. WALK-THROUGH — ENHANCING TEAMS COPILOT CHAT

⸻

A. Pin and Reuse Context
	1.	Open Copilot Chat in Teams (left sidebar → “Chat with Copilot”).
	2.	At the top, paste your General Context Anchor and pin it (hover → three dots → “Pin”).
	3.	Copilot will remember pinned messages during the current session.
	4.	When starting new chats, re-paste or use /context.

⸻

B. Use Document Context

You can attach files to Copilot in Teams:
	1.	In a Copilot chat, click the paperclip icon → upload your file (Word, Excel, PDF).
	2.	Copilot can now read that file’s contents within your tenant boundary.
	3.	Then type prompts like:
	•	“Summarise key triggers in this file.”
	•	“List differences from previous version of the same agreement.”
	•	“Extract numeric thresholds and section references.”

(All processing remains inside your enterprise environment.)

⸻

C. Enable Meeting and Chat Context

If your admin has allowed it:
	1.	Go to Teams Settings → Privacy → Allow Copilot to access meeting recaps and chat history.
	2.	After a meeting, open Copilot in the meeting chat → type “Summarise key actions by party.”
	3.	It will generate a follow-up summary you can refine into your closing email or tracker.

⸻

D. Build a OneNote “Prompt Library”
	1.	Open OneNote (Teams integrated) → create section “Copilot Prompts.”
	2.	Copy the “Reusable Prompt Library” table above.
	3.	You can then copy-paste any line into Copilot when needed.
Tip: Add tags (⭐ “Frequently Used”, 🔍 “Credit”, ⚖️ “Legal”).

⸻

E. Create a Quick-Access Workflow

Here’s how you can use Copilot efficiently day to day:

Scenario	Action
Reviewing a draft Servicing Agreement	Upload doc → run Legal Anchor + “Summarise PDL and trigger sections.”
Preparing for internal credit call	Paste context + “Create 5-bullet executive summary from the attached memo.”
Reconciling modelling notes	Copy model summary → “Explain how CE builds from OC using haircut and discounted purchase price.”
Writing internal update	“Summarise last 10 messages in this thread and produce clean summary for senior management.”


⸻

F. Stay Organised
	•	Create a Teams tab called “Copilot Resources” → link to your OneNote prompt library and setup sheet.
	•	Keep attachments minimal per session (Copilot context resets each chat).
	•	Use @Copilot in team channels to summarise discussions or documents directly.
	•	If allowed, request Copilot for Excel / Word preview for deeper modelling and doc support — the chat version integrates smoothly once enabled.

Would you like me to produce a Word version of this “Teams Copilot Setup & Usage Guide” — fully formatted with tables, headings, and a checklist section you can share internally or keep pinned in Teams? It will include a short executive summary and a step-by-step appendix.
