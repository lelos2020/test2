Here’s a summary of the information presented in the images:

Voluntary Terminations (VT) Overview
	•	MCCF analyzed VT data from VWFS UK covering a 22-year period (since July 2002).
	•	VT levels have historically been low but have increased since 2015 due to:
	1.	Greater consumer awareness of VT options.
	2.	Dealers encouraging VTs to facilitate new car purchases.
	3.	Increased negative equity for customers.
	•	The rise in VT rates is linked to lower used car values, leading to higher borrower negative equity.
	•	Longer-term PCP contracts (4 years vs. 3 years) have also contributed to an increase in VTs.

Recent VT Trends
	•	Since 2020, VT rates have declined, which is positive for auto ABS performance.
	•	Factors contributing to lower VT rates include:
	•	A strong used car market.
	•	Low unemployment rates.
	•	Stricter financing and underwriting policies.
	•	Borrowers prefer selling their cars privately or using them as part-exchange rather than opting for VT.
	•	VWFS UK mainly underwrites prime borrowers, reducing the likelihood of VTs.

Performance & Loss Metrics
	•	The Dynamic Net Loss Ratio (DNL) on VTs has remained stable at 0.03% over the last three years.
	•	Annualized dynamic VT losses peaked in 2019 at 0.33% due to increased VT incidence but have since declined.
	•	The average historical net VT loss for 2024 is 0.22%, consistent with 2023 levels.
	•	PCP and LP contracts tend to have higher VT loss rates compared to HP contracts.

Market & Portfolio Impact
	•	The used car market has mitigated VT loss impacts, except for PCP new vehicles.
	•	VWFS UK’s approach of purchasing VT-subject vehicles helps reduce exposure to market fluctuations and minimizes VT-related risks.

Overall, the data suggests that while VT rates surged after 2015, they have stabilized post-2020 due to favorable market conditions and policy adjustments. VWFS UK’s underwriting strategy and the strength of the used car market continue to support a low VT rate, ensuring stability in the auto ABS sector.
