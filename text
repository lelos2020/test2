The Moody’s methodology shows that a low cumulative default rate—as low as 0.88%—provides strong evidence of inherent portfolio quality. Even if the revolving period allows for additional (and potentially slightly lower‐quality) assets, the impact is mitigated for two reasons.

First, the analysis uses static cohorts that have been “cleaned” by excluding vintages with insufficient data and adjusting for seasoning and trend effects. This process ensures that the mean default rate is representative of long‐term performance, rather than being distorted by early, low‐loss periods or statistical noise. In our case, the 0.88% loss is derived from robust historical data, similar to how Moody’s uses a static cumulative default rate table to project future defaults ( oai_citation:0‡Sector In-Depth - Historical-Default-Data-Analysis-for-ABS-Transactions-in-EMEA - 29Nov05.pdf).

Second, while a 48% coefficient of variation might sound high, it is a relative measure. In absolute terms, 48% of 0.88% equates to a standard deviation of roughly 0.42%. This small absolute variability means that—even if there is some deterioration during the revolving period—the additional losses would be marginal. In effect, the strong historical performance (low mean loss) combined with a modest absolute dispersion supports the conclusion that any quality deterioration is unlikely to be material.

Thus, by relying on a methodology that rigorously cleans and extrapolates historical data, you can justify that the robust performance observed in the static cohorts suggests that the incremental risk during the revolving period is limited.
