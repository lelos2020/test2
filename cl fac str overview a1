# **FACILITY STRUCTURE**

-----

## **1. TRANSACTION OVERVIEW**

### **1.1 Structure Summary**

AUTO1 FT1 B.V. (”**CarCo**” or the “**Borrower**”) operates a revolving warehouse facility secured by a pool of wholesale automotive inventory sourced across EMEA. The facility employs a three-tier capital structure issued through a bankruptcy-remote SPV (AUTO1 Funding 1 B.V., the “**Issuer**”) to institutional noteholders:

|**Class**          |**Current Outstanding**|**7th Amendment Commitment**|**Margin**    |**Advance Rate**|**Legal Final Maturity**|
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|
|**Senior Notes**   |EUR 875m               |**EUR 1,150m**              |E+125bp       |91.5% of NAV    |31 Aug 2028             |
|**Mezzanine Notes**|EUR 130m               |EUR 150m                    |E+350bp       |95.0% of NAV    |31 Aug 2028             |
|**Junior Notes**   |~EUR 50m               |Accordion                   |12.00% (fixed)|100.0% of NAV   |42 months post-closing  |

**Proposed Amendment:** 7th Amendment increases Senior Note commitment from EUR 875m to **EUR 1,150m** (+EUR 275m / +31.4%), with corresponding adjustments to borrowing base mechanics and reserve sizing.

**Collateral:** Eligible automotive inventory purchased by CarCo from auctions, dealers, and direct sellers across Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. Vehicles are held for an average of **42 days** before sale to B2B buyers (independent dealers, exporters) or retail consumers via [AUTO1.com](http://AUTO1.com) platform.

**Originator / Servicer:** AUTO1 Group SE acts as Operating Agent and Servicer. CarCo is a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote subsidiary ringfenced from AUTO1 Group’s broader operations.

**Security Package:**

- First-ranking security over CarCo’s inventory (vehicles, receivables, collection accounts)
- Assignment of intercompany receivables
- Share pledge over CarCo
- Account pledges (Collection Account, Reserve Accounts)

**Rating Agency Coverage:** Moody’s and Scope Ratings provide surveillance ratings on Senior and Mezzanine Notes.

-----

## **2. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT**

### **2.1 Structural Credit Enhancement**

**A. Subordination**

The facility benefits from a **three-tier waterfall** with structural subordination protecting senior creditors:

```
BORROWING BASE MECHANICS:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Eligible Inventory (Net Adjusted Value):        EUR 845.1m (Base: 96.8% of cost)

Senior Note Advance Rate:      91.5%      →    EUR 773.3m capacity
Senior Overcollateralisation:   8.5%      →    EUR 71.8m cushion

Mezzanine Incremental:          3.5%      →    EUR 29.6m incremental capacity  
Mezzanine Total AR:            95.0%      →    EUR 802.9m capacity
Mezzanine Overcollateralisation: 5.0%     →    EUR 42.3m cushion (senior + mezz)

Junior Residual:                5.0%      →    EUR 42.2m residual equity
Junior "Advance Rate":        100.0%      →    EUR 845.1m (full NAV)

TOTAL REQUIRED OVERCOLLATERALISATION: 8.5% (senior) + 5.0% (combined) = 13.5% minimum equity cushion
```

**Senior Protection:** Senior notes are first loss remote by **8.5%** initial overcollateralisation, providing absorption capacity for:

- Portfolio value deterioration (market value decline, aged inventory markdowns)
- Concentration limit breaches (excess amounts excluded from borrowing base)
- Operational losses (vehicles damaged, stolen, or unsaleable)

**B. Reserve Accounts**

Three segregated reserve accounts provide additional liquidity protection:

|**Reserve Account**  |**Required Amount**                                     |**Purpose**                                      |**Release Conditions**                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|**Senior Reserve**   |Greater of: (a) EUR 25m, or (b) 3.5% of Senior Notes O/S|Cover senior interest shortfalls, BB deficiencies|Pro rata release upon senior note amortisation|
|**Mezzanine Reserve**|Greater of: (a) EUR 5m, or (b) 3.5% of Mezz Notes O/S   |Cover mezz interest shortfalls, BB deficiencies  |Pro rata release upon mezz note amortisation  |
|**Trade Tax Reserve**|EUR 2.5m (fixed)                                        |German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) contingency     |Released post-maturity if no tax liability    |

**Current Reserve Levels (Assumed):**

- Senior Reserve: EUR 30.6m (3.5% × EUR 875m)
- Mezzanine Reserve: EUR 4.6m (3.5% × EUR 130m)
- Trade Tax Reserve: EUR 2.5m
- **Total Reserves:** EUR 37.7m

**Post-7th Amendment Reserve Requirement:**

- Senior Reserve: EUR 40.3m (3.5% × EUR 1,150m) → **+EUR 9.7m increase**
- Mezzanine Reserve: EUR 5.3m (3.5% × EUR 150m)
- Trade Tax Reserve: EUR 2.5m
- **Total Reserves:** EUR 48.1m → **+EUR 10.4m incremental funding required**

**Trapped Cash:** Reserve accounts are **non-recourse** to AUTO1 Group and rank senior to all noteholder payments except senior interest and mandatory redemptions.

-----

### **2.2 Performance-Based Credit Enhancement**

**A. Excess Spread**

Historical **net cash trading margin** of ~4.2% (gross margin 6.7%, less operating expenses 2.5%) generates significant excess spread available to:

- Cover credit losses on aged/damaged inventory
- Fund reserve account build
- Amortise notes during controlled run-off

**Stress Testing:**

- **Base Case (6.7% margin):** Covers 6.2x annual interest expense → Strong excess spread coverage
- **Stress Case (4.5% margin):** Covers 4.1x annual interest → Adequate but compressed
- **Severe Stress (2.0% margin):** Covers 1.8x annual interest → Minimal coverage; early amortisation triggered

**B. Cash Trapping (Early Amortisation)**

Upon breach of performance triggers (see Section 5), the facility enters **Early Amortisation**, redirecting excess cash from portfolio growth to **mandatory note amortisation**:

**Pre-Early Amortisation Waterfall:**

- Priorities 1-8: Fees, interest, reserves
- Priority 9-12: Mandatory prepayments (BB compliance)
- Priority 13-14: **Junior notes interest/principal** (if no senior EoD)
- **Residual:** Available for new advances (portfolio growth)

**Post-Early Amortisation Waterfall:**

- Priorities 1-8: Fees, interest, reserves
- Priority 9: **Senior notes principal (sequential amortisation)**
- Priority 10: **Mezzanine notes principal (sequential amortisation)**
- Priority 11-12: Junior notes (if seniors/mezz paid in full)
- **Residual:** Minimal; facility winds down

**Effect:** Early Amortisation converts facility from revolving to term-out, de-leveraging the structure and protecting senior noteholders from deteriorating portfolio quality.

-----

### **2.3 Collateral Quality Enhancement**

**A. Eligibility Criteria (Hard Exclusions)**

Vehicles must satisfy all criteria to be included in borrowing base (see Section 3 for detail):

- Purchase price: EUR 2,000 - EUR 75,000
- Model year: ≤ 10 years old at purchase
- Mileage: ≤ 250,000 km
- No salvage title, major accident damage, or outstanding recalls
- Located in Eligible Jurisdiction
- Not subject to third-party lien or encumbrance

**Current Eligibility Rate:** ~94.5% of total inventory → 5.5% excluded for age, price, damage, or jurisdictional reasons.

**B. Concentration Limits (Portfolio Diversification)**

Hard limits prevent over-concentration in any single risk factor (see Section 4 for detail):

- **Single OEM:** Max 15% of borrowing base (e.g., Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes)
- **Single Country:** Max 65% (Germany concentration limit)
- **Aged Inventory:** Max 5% of vehicles held >90 days

**Breaches:** Excess amounts are **excluded from borrowing base** and do not contribute to advance rate calculation, creating automatic deleveraging.

-----

## **3. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**

### **3.1 Vehicle-Level Eligibility Requirements**

A vehicle is “**Eligible**” for inclusion in the borrowing base only if it satisfies **all** of the following criteria on the relevant Borrowing Base Test Date:

#### **A. Purchase Price**

|**Criterion**|**Threshold**|**Rationale**                                             |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|Minimum      |EUR 2,000    |Excludes scrap/salvage vehicles; ensures minimum liquidity|
|Maximum      |EUR 75,000   |Limits exposure to luxury segment with thin resale market |

**Current Portfolio:** Weighted average purchase price EUR 19,312; 98.7% of vehicles fall within EUR 10k-35k range.

#### **B. Age and Vintage**

|**Criterion**          |**Threshold**                                |**Rationale**                                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|Maximum Age at Purchase|10 years (120 months from first registration)|Older vehicles face rapid depreciation, mechanical risk|
|Excluded Vintages      |Pre-2015 model year (as of 2025)             |Aligns with 10-year lookback                           |

**Current Portfolio:** Weighted average vintage 2.3 years old; 88% are 2020 or newer models.

#### **C. Mileage**

|**Criterion**   |**Threshold**|**Rationale**                                                   |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Maximum Odometer|250,000 km   |High-mileage vehicles face mechanical issues, lower resale value|

**Current Portfolio:** Weighted average mileage ~65,000 km; 96% under 150,000 km.

#### **D. Title and Legal Status**

- **Clean Title:** No salvage, rebuilt, or flood damage designation
- **No Outstanding Recalls:** All safety recalls cleared or vehicle sold “as-is” with disclosure
- **No Third-Party Liens:** CarCo must hold unencumbered legal title
- **Registered Ownership:** Vehicle must be registered in CarCo’s name (or in transit with bill of sale)

**Verification:** Operating Agent conducts title searches via national registries (KBA in Germany, RDW in Netherlands, etc.) prior to funding.

#### **E. Geographic Eligibility**

Vehicle must be **physically located** in an Eligible Jurisdiction:

- ✓ Austria
- ✓ Belgium
- ✓ France
- ✓ Germany (primary market)
- ✓ Italy (subject to Italian Cut-Off Date and legal opinions)
- ✓ Netherlands
- ✓ Poland
- ✓ Spain
- ✗ **Sweden** (excluded from 30 June 2021)
- ✗ Other jurisdictions (require Majority Senior Noteholder consent)

**Rationale:** Limits enforcement risk to jurisdictions with established AUTO1 buyer networks and clear security perfection.

#### **F. Condition and Operability**

- **Driveable:** Vehicle must be in running condition (excludes non-runners, major mechanical failure)
- **No Major Damage:** Excludes vehicles with frame damage, flood exposure, or fire damage
- **Commercially Saleable:** Must be marketable to wholesale buyers without material repair

**Inspection:** AUTO1’s acquisition teams conduct 150-point inspections; any vehicle failing inspection is classified as **Non-Eligible** and funded via junior notes or equity.

#### **G. Time-Based Eligibility**

- **Maximum Days on Book:** 90 days from purchase date
- **Aged Inventory Concentration:** If vehicles >90 days exceed 5% of total inventory, oldest vehicles are excluded until concentration falls below 5%

**Current Status:** 6.8% of vehicles aged >90 days → **Covenant breach** (see Section 6.2).

-----

### **3.2 Ineligibility Event Mechanics**

**Real-Time Monitoring:** Calculation Agent tracks eligibility daily via Operating Agent reports. Upon ineligibility event:

**Step 1: Immediate Exclusion**

- Vehicle is **removed from borrowing base** on the next Borrowing Base Test Date
- Net Adjusted Value is reduced by vehicle’s NAV
- Advance rate is recalculated

**Step 2: Borrowing Base Shortfall Test**

```
IF: New BB Value < Notes Outstanding
THEN: Borrowing Base Shortfall = Notes O/S - BB Value
ACTION: CarCo must prepay shortfall amount by next Utilisation Business Day
```

**Step 3: Remediation Options**
CarCo may cure ineligibility by:

- **Option A:** Selling the ineligible vehicle and using proceeds to prepay notes
- **Option B:** Adding new eligible vehicles to restore BB Value
- **Option C:** Junior noteholder injects cure capital (per NIFA 6.2/7.2)

**Step 4: Failure to Cure**
If shortfall not cured within required timeframe:

- **Senior/Mezz Shortfall:** Event of Default (non-payment) after 10 BD grace period
- **Repeated Shortfalls:** Potential Early Amortisation Event trigger

-----

### **3.3 Eligibility Verification Process**

**Daily Reporting:** Operating Agent delivers Borrowing Base Certificate to Calculation Agent by 12:00 CET each Utilisation Business Day, certifying:

- Vehicle-level eligibility status (VIN-by-VIN)
- Aggregate Eligible Inventory value
- Concentration limit compliance
- Ageing bucket distribution

**Bi-Weekly Formal Reporting:** Full Borrowing Base Report delivered to Senior Agents on each Settlement Date (every 14 days), including:

- Detailed vehicle inventory stratification
- Eligibility exclusions with reasons
- Historical trend analysis (turn velocity, margin realization)
- Covenant compliance certificates

**Annual Audit:** Independent auditor (Big 4 accounting firm) conducts annual review of:

- Eligibility criteria application consistency
- Title/lien searches (sample-based)
- Collateral existence verification (physical inspections)

-----

## **4. CONCENTRATION LIMITS**

### **4.1 Overview and Rationale**

Concentration limits prevent **single-name risk** and ensure portfolio diversification across OEMs, geographies, and vehicle segments. Excess amounts above limits are **excluded from Net Adjusted Value**, creating automatic deleveraging upon breach.

### **4.2 OEM / Make Concentration**

**Single Make Limit: 15% of Eligible Inventory Value**

|**Make**     |**Illustrative Portfolio %**|**Limit**|**Headroom**|**Commentary**                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------|---------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
|Volkswagen   |14.8%                       |15.0%    |0.2%        |**TIGHT** - Minimal capacity to add VW inventory|
|BMW          |11.2%                       |15.0%    |3.8%        |Adequate headroom                               |
|Mercedes-Benz|10.9%                       |15.0%    |4.1%        |Adequate headroom                               |
|Audi         |9.7%                        |15.0%    |5.3%        |Comfortable                                     |
|Ford         |8.3%                        |15.0%    |6.7%        |Comfortable                                     |
|Others       |<15% each                   |15.0%    |Varies      |Compliant                                       |

**Calculation Methodology:**

```
Make Concentration % = (NAV of Make X vehicles) / (Total Eligible Inventory NAV)

IF: Make X > 15%
THEN: Excess Amount = (Make X NAV) - (15% × Total NAV)
ACTION: Exclude Excess Amount from BB calculation
```

**Example:**

```
Volkswagen NAV:           EUR 125.0m
Total Eligible NAV:       EUR 845.1m
VW Concentration:         14.8% (compliant)

If VW increased to:       EUR 130.0m
VW Concentration:         15.4% (breach)
Excess Amount:            EUR 130.0m - (15% × EUR 845.1m) = EUR 3.2m
Adjusted VW NAV:          EUR 126.8m (capped at 15%)
```

**Remediation:** CarCo must either (a) sell excess VW inventory, or (b) add non-VW inventory to dilute VW concentration below 15%.

-----

### **4.3 Geographic Concentration**

**Single Country Limit: 65% of Eligible Inventory Value** (Germany-specific)

|**Country**|**Illustrative Portfolio %**|**Limit**        |**Status**               |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
|Germany    |60.0%                       |65.0%            |✓ Compliant (5% headroom)|
|France     |17.0%                       |No specific limit|✓                        |
|Poland     |10.0%                       |No specific limit|✓                        |
|Spain      |7.0%                        |No specific limit|✓                        |
|Italy      |5.0%                        |No specific limit|✓                        |
|Others     |1.0%                        |No specific limit|✓                        |

**Rationale:** Germany represents AUTO1’s core market with deepest liquidity, justifying higher concentration tolerance. Limit prevents over-reliance on single-country economic conditions.

**Risk Consideration:** 60% Germany concentration creates material exposure to German used car market cycles, GDP growth, and consumer confidence. Stress testing should model German-specific recession scenario.

-----

### **4.4 Vintage Concentration**

**No explicit hard limit**, but Operating Agent targets:

- **Current year (2025):** <10% (avoids high depreciation risk)
- **1-3 years old (2022-2024):** 60-70% (core inventory)
- **4-5 years old (2020-2021):** 15-25% (value segment)
- **6+ years old (pre-2020):** <5% (aged inventory management)

**Current Distribution Aligns with Targets:** Weighted average vintage 2.3 years old.

-----

### **4.5 Aged Inventory Concentration**

**Hard Limit: 5% of Eligible Inventory Units**

**Current Status:**

- Vehicles >90 days on book: **6.8% of eligible units**
- **Status: BREACH** (1.8% above limit)

**Calculation:**

```
Aged Inventory % = (# of vehicles >90 days) / (Total eligible vehicles)

Current: 3,078 aged vehicles / 45,234 eligible = 6.8%
Limit: 5.0%
Excess: 1.8% or ~814 vehicles
```

**Action Required:**

- CarCo must sell or otherwise remove 814 vehicles from eligible inventory
- OR increase total eligible inventory to dilute aged concentration below 5%
- Failure to cure within covenant cure period triggers **Early Amortisation Event**

**Loss Implications:**

- Aged inventory (>90 days) realizes average **13% loss** vs. purchase price
- If 814 vehicles @ EUR 19k avg = EUR 15.5m exposure
- Expected loss: EUR 15.5m × 13% = **EUR 2.0m** potential write-down

-----

### **4.6 Purchase Price Concentration**

**No explicit hard limits**, but Internal Risk Guidelines target:

- **EUR 0-10k:** <15% (sub-prime quality risk)
- **EUR 10-20k:** 40-60% (core inventory)
- **EUR 20-35k:** 25-40% (premium segment)
- **EUR 35k+:** <10% (luxury illiquidity risk)

**Current Distribution Complies:** 65% in EUR 10-25k range; weighted average EUR 19.3k.

-----

### **4.7 Excess Amount Treatment**

**Waterfall Application:**

When concentration limits are breached, excess amounts are:

1. **Excluded from Net Adjusted Value** in borrowing base calculation
1. **Not eligible for advance rate application** (cannot borrow against excess)
1. **Treated as non-eligible inventory** for covenant compliance purposes
1. **Must be liquidated or diluted** to restore compliance

**Priority for Exclusion (Operating Agent discretion):**

- Oldest vehicles in excess category excluded first
- Lowest margin vehicles excluded second
- Vehicles with mechanical issues excluded third

**Financial Impact Example:**

```
Base Case (No Breach):
  Eligible Inventory NAV:      EUR 845.1m
  Senior AR (91.5%):            EUR 773.3m capacity

Concentration Breach (VW excess EUR 3.2m):
  Adjusted Eligible NAV:        EUR 841.9m (EUR 845.1m - EUR 3.2m)
  Senior AR (91.5%):            EUR 770.3m capacity
  Capacity Loss:                EUR 3.0m ← immediate deleveraging
```

-----

## **5. PERFORMANCE TRIGGERS**

### **5.1 Early Amortisation Events**

**Early Amortisation** converts the facility from revolving to sequential amortisation, redirecting excess spread from portfolio growth to mandatory note repayment. The following events trigger Early Amortisation:

#### **A. Cash Trading Margin Breach**

**Trigger:** Cash Trading Margin < **5.0%** on any Settlement Date

**Definition:**

```
Cash Trading Margin = (Available Liquidity) / (Total Eligible Inventory Value)

Where:
  Available Liquidity = Cash in Collection Account
                      + Undrawn Senior Note Commitment
                      - Minimum Operating Balance (EUR 10m)
                      - Pending Settlement Payables
  
  Total Eligible Inventory = NAV of all eligible vehicles
```

**Illustrative Calculation (Current - Compliant):**

```
Collection Account Balance:         EUR 64.2m
Undrawn Senior Commitment:          EUR 430.0m (EUR 1,150m - EUR 720m O/S)
Less: Min Operating Balance:        (EUR 10.0m)
Less: Pending Payables:             (EUR 18.3m)
Available Liquidity:                EUR 465.9m

Total Eligible Inventory:           EUR 873.2m

Cash Trading Margin:                53.4% ✓ PASS (48.4% cushion)
```

**Stress Scenario (5% Trigger Level):**

```
For CTM to hit 5%:
  Required Liquidity = 5% × Inventory
  
If Inventory grows to:              EUR 1,800m
Required Liquidity:                 EUR 90m
Available Liquidity:                EUR 465.9m (assuming same undrawn)
Calculated CTM:                     25.9% ✓ Still compliant

Conclusion: CTM trigger is NOT BINDING under realistic growth scenarios
           Facility can support 2x inventory growth before CTM breach
```

**Risk Assessment:** **LOW** - Trigger provides minimal constraint; not expected to activate absent severe liquidity stress.

-----

#### **B. Borrowing Base Coverage Test**

**Senior Note Trigger:** Senior BB Value < **100%** of Senior Notes Outstanding

**Calculation:**

```
Senior BB Coverage = (Senior BB Value) / (Senior Notes O/S)

Where:
  Senior BB Value = Eligible Inventory NAV × 91.5%
```

**Current Status (Post-7th Amendment Assumed):**

```
Eligible Inventory NAV:             EUR 845.1m
Senior BB Value:                    EUR 773.3m (91.5% × EUR 845.1m)
Senior Notes O/S:                   EUR 720.0m (current) or EUR 1,150m (proposed)

Current Coverage:                   107.4% ✓ PASS
Post-Amendment Coverage:            67.2% ✗ **FAIL** if drawn to EUR 1,150m
```

**CRITICAL OBSERVATION:**

- **If Senior Notes drawn to full EUR 1,150m commitment, BB shortfall = EUR 376.7m**
- **CarCo would need to:**
  - Add EUR 412m of new eligible inventory (EUR 376.7m ÷ 91.5% AR), OR
  - Prepay EUR 376.7m of senior notes immediately

**Implication:** 7th Amendment upsize assumes **portfolio growth to EUR 1.45bn+** to support full senior commitment drawdown.

**Mezzanine Note Trigger:** Mezz BB Value < **100%** of (Senior + Mezz) Notes Outstanding

**Current Status (Illustrative):**

```
Eligible Inventory NAV:             EUR 845.1m  
Mezz BB Value:                      EUR 802.9m (95% × EUR 845.1m)
Senior + Mezz Notes O/S:            EUR 850.0m (EUR 720m + EUR 130m)

Mezzanine Coverage:                 94.5% ✗ **FAIL** (EUR 47.1m shortfall)
```

**Action Required:**

- CarCo must prepay EUR 47.1m of mezzanine notes by next Utilisation Business Day, OR
- Add EUR 49.6m of new eligible inventory to restore BB Value

**Frequency:** BB coverage tested **bi-weekly** on each Settlement Date.

-----

#### **C. Reserve Account Deficiency**

**Trigger:** Reserve Accounts < Required Amounts on any Settlement Date (after waterfall application)

**Required Amounts:**

- **Senior Reserve:** Greater of (a) EUR 25m, or (b) 3.5% of Senior Notes O/S
- **Mezzanine Reserve:** Greater of (a) EUR 5m, or (b) 3.5% of Mezz Notes O/S
- **Trade Tax Reserve:** EUR 2.5m (fixed)

**Grace Period:** 10 Business Days to cure deficiency via:

- Collections reinvestment (diverted from portfolio growth)
- Junior note issuance (cure capital injection)
- Note prepayment (reducing required reserve amount)

**Current Compliance:** **ASSUMED COMPLIANT** (reserves fully funded at EUR 37.7m).

**Post-7th Amendment:** Required senior reserve increases to EUR 40.3m (+EUR 9.7m).

-----

#### **D. Covenant Breach Events**

**See Section 6 for detail.** Key covenant breaches that trigger Early Amortisation:

- Financial covenants (e.g., minimum net worth, leverage ratios) - **NOT APPLICABLE** (CarCo is SPV with no financial covenants)
- Operational covenants (e.g., portfolio quality metrics):
  - Aged Inventory >5% for >30 days (currently **BREACHED** at 6.8%)
  - Concentration limits exceeded and not cured within 15 BD

-----

#### **E. Servicer Events**

**See Section 8 for detail.** Servicer Termination Events include:

- Servicer insolvency
- Material breach of servicing obligations
- Fraud or gross negligence
- Failure to remit collections within 2 BD

Upon Servicer Termination, **Back-Up Servicer** (pre-appointed) assumes servicing duties. If Back-Up Servicer unavailable or unwilling, **Early Amortisation Event** occurs.

-----

### **5.2 Enforcement Events**

More severe than Early Amortisation; triggers **immediate acceleration** and **Security Trustee enforcement**.

#### **CarCo Enforcement Event**

**Trigger Events:**

1. **CarCo Insolvency:** Filing for bankruptcy, insolvency, or analogous proceeding
1. **Non-Payment:** Failure to pay principal or interest after 15 BD grace period
1. **Material Breach:** Breach of representations, warranties, or covenants (if not cured within 30 days)
1. **Cross-Default:** Default under other material indebtedness (>EUR 10m)

**Action Upon Enforcement:**

- Security Trustee delivers **CarCo Enforcement Notice**
- All commitments immediately cancelled
- All notes become immediately due and payable
- Security Trustee assumes control of Collection Account
- **Post-Enforcement Waterfall** applies:
  - Priority 1-4: Fees, senior interest, senior principal
  - Priority 5-6: Fees, mezz interest, mezz principal
  - Priority 7-8: Junior interest, junior principal

**Enforcement Powers:**

- Appoint Receiver over CarCo Charged Property
- Liquidate inventory (forced sales to approved buyers)
- Assign servicing to third party
- Pursue legal recourse against Operating Agent (if fraud/gross negligence)

#### **Issuer Enforcement Event**

**Trigger Events:**

1. **Issuer Insolvency:** Bankruptcy filing by AUTO1 Funding 1 B.V.
1. **Non-Payment (Pre-Maturity):** Failure to pay senior/mezz interest or principal (5 BD grace)
1. **Non-Payment (Maturity):** Failure to pay any note on Final Maturity Date (no grace period)
1. **Material Breach:** Breach of Issuer covenants (30 day cure period)

**Majority Noteholder Control:** Upon Issuer Event of Default, **Majority Senior Noteholders** (>66 2/3%) may instruct Security Trustee to deliver Issuer Enforcement Notice.

**Effect:** Similar to CarCo Enforcement; immediate acceleration, enforcement waterfall, liquidation.

-----

### **5.3 Trigger Monitoring and Reporting**

**Daily Monitoring (Internal):**

- Operating Agent tracks BB coverage, concentration limits, eligibility compliance
- Real-time alerts if triggers approach (e.g., BB coverage <105%)

**Bi-Weekly Formal Certification:**

- Calculation Agent delivers **Trigger Compliance Certificate** on each Settlement Date
- Certifies compliance with all triggers and covenants
- Flags any breaches or imminent breaches (within 5% of trigger level)

**Monthly Reporting to Lenders:**

- Summary dashboard: BB coverage, CTM, reserve balances, concentration heat map
- Trend analysis: historical trigger metrics (12-month lookback)
- Forward-looking projections: stress scenarios (10% inventory markdown, 60-day turn elongation)

**Quarterly Investor Calls:**

- Senior Noteholders invited to join quarterly update calls with AUTO1 management
- Discussion of portfolio performance, market conditions, strategic initiatives
- Q&A session for lender concerns

-----

## **6. COVENANTS**

### **6.1 Affirmative Covenants (CarCo)**

CarCo must:

#### **A. Financial Reporting**

|**Report**                 |**Frequency**              |**Delivery Deadline**  |**Content**                                             |

-----

### **6.3 Covenants - Operating Agent / Servicer**

AUTO1 Group SE, as Operating Agent and Servicer, must:

#### **A. Servicing Standards**

- Service portfolio in accordance with **Servicing Standard** (defined as level of care exercised by AUTO1 for its proprietary inventory)
- Maintain all required licenses and permits (dealer licenses, auction memberships)
- Comply with consumer protection laws (price transparency, warranty disclosures)
- Maintain errors and omissions insurance (EUR 5m coverage)

#### **B. Collections Management**

- Remit 100% of collections to Collection Account within **2 Business Days** of receipt
- No commingling of CarCo collections with AUTO1 Group funds
- Maintain sub-ledgers identifying each collection by vehicle VIN
- Reconcile collections daily (actual cash vs. expected proceeds)

#### **C. Reporting and Record-Keeping**

- Maintain complete servicing records (purchase contracts, sale agreements, inspection reports)
- Provide Calculation Agent access to records upon request (5 BD notice)
- Deliver monthly servicing reports (delinquencies, losses, aged inventory actions)
- Maintain IT systems with disaster recovery (RPO: 24 hours, RTO: 48 hours)

#### **D. No Material Adverse Change**

- Notify Security Trustee immediately of any **Material Adverse Effect** affecting:
  - AUTO1 Group’s financial condition (e.g., liquidity crisis, going concern doubt)
  - AUTO1 Group’s ability to perform servicing obligations
  - Validity or enforceability of Transaction Documents

-----

### **6.4 Financial Covenants (AUTO1 Group SE)**

While CarCo has **no financial covenants** (as an SPV), AUTO1 Group SE (parent guarantor for servicing obligations) must maintain:

#### **A. Minimum Liquidity**

- Maintain unrestricted cash and undrawn committed facilities ≥ **EUR 100m** at consolidated level
- Tested quarterly
- Breach triggers mandatory reporting and potential Servicer review

#### **B. Tangible Net Worth**

- Maintain consolidated tangible net worth ≥ **EUR 300m**
- Tested quarterly
- Adjusted for intangibles (goodwill, brand value) and subordinated debt

#### **C. Interest Coverage**

- Maintain consolidated EBITDA / Interest Expense ≥ **2.0x**
- Tested quarterly (rolling 4-quarter basis)
- Excludes non-cash charges (depreciation, stock-based compensation)

**Rationale:** Ensures AUTO1 Group remains financially viable to perform servicing obligations. Breach of financial covenants triggers **Servicer Review Event** (not automatic termination), allowing noteholders to assess remediation plans.

-----

### **6.5 Covenant Breach Cure Mechanics**

#### **Step 1: Notice of Breach**

- CarCo or Servicer must notify Security Trustee within **5 Business Days** of becoming aware of breach
- Security Trustee notifies all Noteholders within **2 Business Days**

#### **Step 2: Cure Period**

|**Covenant Type**              |**Cure Period**              |**Permitted Cure Actions**                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|**Borrowing Base Shortfall**   |Next Utilisation Business Day|Add inventory, prepay notes, junior cure capital|
|**Reserve Deficiency**         |10 Business Days             |Divert collections, issue junior notes          |
|**Aged Inventory >5%**         |30 calendar days             |Liquidate aged units, grow eligible inventory   |
|**Concentration Breach**       |15 Business Days             |Sell excess, dilute with new purchases          |
|**Financial Covenants (AUTO1)**|30 calendar days             |Equity injection, asset sales, debt refinancing |

#### **Step 3: Failure to Cure**

If breach not cured within cure period:

- **Minor Covenants:** Trigger Early Amortisation Event (cash trap, no new advances)
- **Material Covenants:** Trigger Event of Default (immediate acceleration, enforcement)

**Majority Noteholder Waiver:**

- Breaches may be **waived** by Majority Senior Noteholders (>66 2/3%)
- Waiver must be in writing and may include conditions (e.g., fees, pricing step-up)
- One-time waivers typical; repeated waivers require structural amendment

-----

## **7. EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

### **7.1 CarCo Events of Default**

The following events constitute an Event of Default under the Loan Agreements:

#### **A. Non-Payment**

**Trigger:** Failure to pay principal, interest, or fees when due

**Grace Period:**

- **Principal:** 15 Business Days
- **Interest:** 10 Business Days (5 BD if on Maturity Date)
- **Fees:** 15 Business Days

**Rationale for Grace Period:** Allows time for administrative errors (payment processing delays) to be corrected; prevents technical defaults from operational glitches.

**Cure Mechanism:** Non-payment cured if:

- Amount paid in full within grace period, **AND**
- Junior noteholder has NOT injected cure capital (per NIFA 6.2/7.2)
  - If juniors cure, grace period clock resets; seniors may still enforce if fundamental issue exists

**Current Risk Assessment:** **LOW** - CarCo has consistent positive cash flow from trading operations; no historical non-payments.

-----

#### **B. Breach of Covenants**

**Trigger:** Failure to comply with any covenant under Transaction Documents

**Cure Period:**

- **Borrowing Base Certificate delivery:** 5 Business Days
- **Financial reporting:** 15 Business Days
- **Other covenants:** 30 calendar days

**Exceptions (No Cure Period):**

- Bankruptcy remoteness covenants (immediate EoD)
- Fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct (immediate EoD)
- Repeated breaches of same covenant (>3 times in 12 months = immediate EoD)

-----

#### **C. Misrepresentation**

**Trigger:** Any representation or warranty proves materially false when made

**Cure Period:** **30 days** if capable of remedy

**Examples:**

- **Curable:** “All vehicles have clean title” → One vehicle has undisclosed lien (can be removed)
- **Incurable:** “CarCo has no undisclosed litigation” → Material litigation exists (cannot undo)

**Materiality Threshold:** Misrepresentation must be **material** to trigger EoD:

- Affects >5% of borrowing base value, OR
- Impairs Security Trustee’s security interest, OR
- Relates to financial condition having Material Adverse Effect

-----

#### **D. Cross-Default**

**Trigger:** Default under other **Material Indebtedness** of CarCo

**Definition of Material Indebtedness:**

- Outstanding amount >**EUR 10,000,000**, OR
- Indebtedness that, if accelerated, would have Material Adverse Effect on CarCo’s ability to perform obligations

**Scope:** Captures defaults under:

- Hedging agreements (if notional >EUR 10m)
- Leases or equipment financing (if aggregate >EUR 10m)
- **NOT applicable to AUTO1 Group debt** (separate legal entity; non-recourse)

**Current Exposure:** **NIL** - CarCo has no material indebtedness outside Transaction Documents.

-----

#### **E. Insolvency**

**Trigger:** Any of the following with respect to CarCo:

- Filing of insolvency, bankruptcy, or analogous proceeding
- Appointment of receiver, administrator, or trustee
- Admission of inability to pay debts as they fall due
- Suspension of payments to creditors generally

**No Cure Period:** Insolvency Events trigger **immediate** Event of Default.

**Bankruptcy Remoteness Protections:**

- Independent director (no affiliation to AUTO1 Group) holds “Golden Share”
- Golden Share holder must consent to any insolvency filing
- Independent director has fiduciary duty to creditors (not AUTO1 shareholders)

**Risk Mitigation:** Structural protections make CarCo insolvency highly unlikely absent fraud or legal challenge to SPV structure.

-----

#### **F. Material Adverse Effect**

**Trigger:** Occurrence of event having **Material Adverse Effect** on:

- CarCo’s business or financial condition, OR
- Validity or enforceability of Transaction Documents, OR
- Security Trustee’s security interest in CarCo Charged Property

**Cure Period:** **30 days** if capable of remedy

**Examples:**

- **MAE on business:** German government bans used car exports (40% of AUTO1’s buyers are exporters)
- **MAE on enforceability:** Netherlands court rules CarCo security structure unenforceable
- **MAE on security:** Government confiscates inventory (war, expropriation)

**Subjectivity:** “Material Adverse Effect” is intentionally broad; interpretation depends on facts and circumstances. Majority Noteholders have discretion to declare EoD.

-----

#### **G. Unlawfulness**

**Trigger:** It becomes unlawful for CarCo to perform obligations under Transaction Documents

**Examples:**

- Sanctions prohibit lending to AUTO1-affiliated entities
- Regulatory change prohibits securitisation structure
- Tax law change renders structure non-viable

**Mandatory Prepayment:** Upon illegality, CarCo must prepay all notes (subject to available funds and Priority of Payments).

-----

### **7.2 Issuer Events of Default**

The following events constitute an Issuer Event of Default:

#### **A. Non-Payment (Pre-Maturity)**

**Trigger:**

- Failure to pay **senior or mezzanine** interest, principal, or fees when due (5 BD grace)
- Failure to pay **senior agents** fees when due (15 BD grace)

**Junior Notes Exception:** Non-payment of junior notes is **NOT** an Issuer Event of Default unless seniors and mezz are fully repaid.

**Grace Period Logic:** 5 BD grace allows time for:

- Collections to clear (T+3 settlement lag)
- Junior cure capital injection (per NIFA 6.2/7.2)
- Administrative error correction

-----

#### **B. Non-Payment (Maturity Date)**

**Trigger:** Failure to pay **any note** on Final Maturity Date (31 Aug 2028)

**No Grace Period:** Maturity Date non-payment is immediate EoD.

**Rationale:** By Maturity Date, Issuer has had 4+ years to amortise notes and wind down portfolio. Failure to pay on maturity indicates terminal failure.

-----

#### **C. Reserve Account Deficiency**

**Trigger:** Reserve Accounts below required amounts on any Settlement Date (after waterfall application), not cured within **10 Business Days**

**Deficiency Test:**

```
Required Amount:
  Senior Reserve:    Max(EUR 25m, 3.5% × Senior Notes O/S)
  Mezzanine Reserve: Max(EUR 5m, 3.5% × Mezz Notes O/S)
  Trade Tax Reserve: EUR 2.5m

IF: Actual Balance < Required Amount on Settlement Date
THEN: Issue notice to Issuer and Security Trustee
      10 BD cure period begins

IF: Not cured within 10 BD
THEN: Issuer Event of Default occurs
```

**Cure Mechanics:** Issuer may cure by:

- Diverting future collections to reserve accounts (via waterfall Priority 8)
- Receiving junior cure capital (applied to reserves)
- Reducing note balances (lowers required reserve amount)

-----

#### **D. Breach of Covenants**

**Material Breach:** Failure to perform obligations owed to Senior Noteholders, with **Material Adverse Effect**, not cured within **30 days**

**Securitisation Regulation Compliance:** Failure to comply with Article 7 STS requirements (transparency, simplicity, standardisation), not cured within **6 months**

**Breach of Fundamental Covenants:** Immediate EoD (no cure period):

- Change of COMI outside Netherlands
- Become an Alternative Investment Fund (AIFMD)
- Permit Transaction Security to become invalid or unenforceable (subject to Legal Reservations)

-----

#### **E. Insolvency**

**Trigger:** Issuer (AUTO1 Funding 1 B.V.) files for insolvency or analogous proceeding

**No Cure Period:** Immediate Event of Default.

**Ring-Fencing:** Issuer has same bankruptcy remoteness protections as CarCo (Golden Share, independent director, no business activities outside Transaction Documents).

-----

#### **F. Cross-Defaults (Issuer)**

**Trigger:** CarCo Event of Default under Senior Loan Agreement or Mezzanine Loan Agreement

**Mechanism:**

- CarCo EoD → Lender (Issuer) declares CarCo loans due and payable
- Issuer lacks funds to pay noteholders (CarCo is sole asset)
- Issuer defaults to noteholders → Issuer Event of Default

**Linkage:** Issuer’s obligations are **structurally dependent** on CarCo performance. CarCo failure = Issuer failure.

-----

### **7.3 Remedies Upon Event of Default**

#### **A. Acceleration**

**Majority Noteholder Instruction:** Upon EoD, Majority Senior Noteholders may instruct Security Trustee to:

- Declare all notes immediately due and payable
- Cancel all commitments (no new advances)
- Deliver Enforcement Notice to CarCo/Issuer

**Voting Threshold:**

- **Majority Senior Noteholders:** >66 2/3% of Senior Notes Outstanding Amount
- Excludes Defaulting Noteholders (failed to fund participation)

**Automatic Acceleration:** Certain EoDs trigger automatic acceleration (no instruction required):

- Insolvency of CarCo or Issuer
- Non-payment on Maturity Date
- Fraud or wilful misconduct

-----

#### **B. Enforcement of Security**

Upon delivery of Enforcement Notice, Security Trustee may:

**Immediate Actions:**

- Take control of Collection Account and Reserve Accounts
- Appoint Receiver over CarCo Charged Property
- Direct Operating Agent to cease new vehicle purchases
- Instruct Servicer to liquidate inventory (orderly or forced sale)

**Ongoing Management:**

- Servicer continues servicing under Security Trustee supervision
- If Servicer terminated, Backup Servicer assumes duties
- Collections applied per **Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments**

**Liquidation Strategy:**

- **Orderly Liquidation (Preferred):** Sell vehicles through normal B2B channels over 60-90 days
  - Target: Realise 95-100% of NAV
  - Time: 3-6 months to fully liquidate portfolio
- **Forced Liquidation (Accelerated):** Bulk sale to liquidators or auction houses
  - Target: Realise 70-85% of NAV (15-30% haircut)
  - Time: 30-60 days to liquidate

**Distribution of Proceeds:** Post-Enforcement Waterfall (see Section 7.4)

-----

#### **C. Noteholder Remedies**

**Individual Noteholder Actions:** Generally prohibited; enforcement actions must be directed by Majority Noteholders through Security Trustee.

**Exception:** Individual Noteholder may sue for payment if:

- Noteholder’s pro rata share of payment is unpaid after acceleration
- Noteholder has not received payment within 60 days of due date
- **ONLY for own pro rata claim** (cannot sue on behalf of class)

**No Setoff:** Noteholders may not setoff claims against Issuer/CarCo.

-----

### **7.4 Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments**

Upon Enforcement Event, collections are applied in the following order:

```
POST-ENFORCEMENT WATERFALL (CarCo):
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1.  Taxes, levies, and assessments (unsubordinated)
2.  Security Trustee fees, expenses, indemnities
3.  Operating Agent / Servicer fees (capped at 60 days)
4.  SENIOR NOTE INTEREST (accrued and unpaid)
5.  SENIOR NOTE PRINCIPAL (Outstanding Amounts)
6.  Senior Note enforcement costs, breakage fees
7.  Mezzanine Note interest (accrued and unpaid)
8.  Mezzanine Note principal (Outstanding Amounts)
9.  Mezzanine Note enforcement costs
10. Junior Note interest (accrued and unpaid)
11. Junior Note principal (Outstanding Amounts)
12. Junior Note enforcement costs
13. Subordinated creditors (if any)
14. Equity (CarCo shareholder - AUTO1 Group SE)

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Key Observations:**

- **Senior notes paid in full** before any mezz notes receive principal
- **No reserve account funding** in post-enforcement (reserves already funded or released)
- **Operating fees capped** at 60 days to limit dilution of creditor recoveries
- **Sequential amortisation** (no pro rata sharing across classes)

**Recovery Analysis (Illustrative Stress Scenario):**

```
ASSUMPTIONS:
  Total Eligible Inventory NAV:        EUR 845.1m
  Liquidation Strategy:                Forced (60 days)
  Liquidation Recovery:                75% of NAV (25% haircut)
  Gross Liquidation Proceeds:          EUR 633.8m

WATERFALL APPLICATION:
  P1-3: Taxes, trustee, servicer fees: (EUR 5.0m)
  P4:   Senior interest (6 months):    (EUR 18.0m)
  P5:   Senior principal:              (EUR 720.0m)
  
  Remaining for Mezz:                  EUR 0 ← WIPEOUT
  
RECOVERIES:
  Senior Notes:    100% (paid in full: EUR 738m)
  Mezzanine Notes:   0% (total loss: EUR 130m)
  Junior Notes:      0% (total loss: EUR 50m)
```

**Sensitivity:**

- **80% recovery:** Seniors recover 100%, Mezz recover 15%, Juniors 0%
- **85% recovery:** Seniors recover 100%, Mezz recover 80%, Juniors 0%
- **90% recovery:** Seniors recover 100%, Mezz recover 100%, Juniors 40%

**Conclusion:** Senior notes benefit from significant credit enhancement; mezz notes are first loss to portfolios experiencing >15% liquidation haircut.

-----

## **8. SERVICER TERMINATION EVENTS**

### **8.1 Servicer Role and Criticality**

**AUTO1 Group SE** acts as **Servicer** and **Operating Agent**, performing:

- Vehicle acquisition (sourcing, bidding, pricing)
- Inventory management (storage, refurbishment, marketing)
- Sales execution (B2B auctions, retail platform management)
- Collections management (payment processing, remittance to Collection Account)
- Reporting (daily BBR, monthly operating reports)

**Criticality:** Servicing operations are **mission-critical**. AUTO1’s proprietary platform, buyer network, and pricing algorithms are non-replicable in short term. Servicer failure would result in immediate liquidity crisis and portfolio value deterioration.

-----

### **8.2 Servicer Termination Events**

The following events permit **termination of Servicer** and appointment of Backup Servicer:

#### **A. Servicer Insolvency**

**Trigger:** AUTO1 Group SE:

- Files for insolvency, bankruptcy, or analogous proceeding
- Admits inability to pay debts
- Has receiver or administrator appointed
- Suspends payments to creditors generally

**Automatic Termination:** Insolvency triggers immediate termination (no notice or cure period required).

**Risk Mitigation:**

- **Backup Servicer** (pre-appointed major German bank or specialised auto servicer) assumes duties within **10 Business Days**
- Backup Servicer has **warm handover rights** (access to systems, data, buyer lists 60 days prior to activation)

-----

#### **A. Failure to Remit Collections**

**Trigger:** Servicer fails to remit collections to Collection Account within **2 Business Days** of receipt

**Cure Period:** **5 Business Days** from due date

**Materiality Threshold:** Applies if:

- Single remittance failure >EUR 1,000,000, OR
- Aggregate remittances in any 30-day period >EUR 5,000,000, OR
- Pattern of late remittances (>3 instances in 6 months)

**Rationale:** 2 BD remittance requirement ensures real-time cash visibility; delays indicate potential commingling or liquidity stress.

-----

#### **C. Material Breach of Servicing Standards**

**Trigger:** Servicer fails to perform servicing obligations in accordance with **Servicing Standard** (level of care exercised by AUTO1 for proprietary inventory)

**Examples:**

- Failure to insure inventory (lapse in coverage)
- Failure to maintain vehicles (allowing deterioration, weathering)
- Failure to pursue collections (writing off debts without pursuing buyers)
- Fraud or gross negligence in vehicle acquisitions (overpaying, kickbacks)

**Cure Period:** **30 days** from notice

**Materiality:** Breach must have (or be reasonably likely to have) **Material Adverse Effect** on portfolio value or noteholder recoveries.

-----

#### **D. Failure to Deliver Reports**

**Trigger:** Servicer fails to deliver required reports:

- Daily Borrowing Base Certificate: 12:00 CET deadline
- Monthly Operating Report: 15th of following month
- Annual Financial Statements: 120 days post year-end

**Cure Period:**

- **Daily BBR:** 2 Business Days (5 BD for initial notice)
- **Monthly reports:** 10 Business Days
- **Annual reports:** 30 days

**Materiality:** Repeated failures (>3 in 12 months) = Servicer Termination Event (no materiality threshold).

-----

#### **E. Change of Control**

**Trigger:** AUTO1 Group SE undergoes **Change of Control** without prior Majority Noteholder consent

**Definition of Change of Control:**

- Acquisition of >50% voting equity by third party, OR
- Change in board composition (>50% of directors replaced within 12 months), OR
- Sale of substantially all assets (>75% of enterprise value)

**Consent Requirement:** Majority Senior Noteholders must approve Change of Control (>66 2/3% vote).

**Rationale:** AUTO1’s servicing capability is tied to management expertise and platform IP; acquirer may lack necessary skills or may prioritise competing business objectives.

-----

#### **F. Financial Covenant Breach (AUTO1 Group)**

**Trigger:** AUTO1 Group SE breaches financial covenants (Section 6.4):

- Minimum liquidity <EUR 100m
- Tangible net worth <EUR 300m
- Interest coverage <2.0x

**Cure Period:** **30 days**

**Servicer Review (Not Automatic Termination):** Financial covenant breach triggers **mandatory Servicer review** by Majority Noteholders:

- Assessment of AUTO1’s ability to continue servicing
- Evaluation of Backup Servicer transition costs and timing
- Decision: (a) waive breach with conditions, (b) terminate Servicer

-----

#### **G. Material Misrepresentation**

**Trigger:** Servicer makes material misrepresentation in servicing reports (e.g., falsifying inventory data, concealing losses)

**No Cure Period:** Fraud or wilful misrepresentation = immediate termination.

**Legal Recourse:** Noteholders may pursue damages against AUTO1 Group SE for fraudulent servicing.

-----

### **8.3 Servicer Termination Process**

#### **Step 1: Notice of Termination**

- **Initiator:** Security Trustee (acting on Majority Noteholder instruction)
- **Delivery:** Written notice to Servicer, Issuer, CarCo, Calculation Agent
- **Effective Date:** Specified in notice (typically 10-30 BD after delivery)

#### **Step 2: Backup Servicer Activation**

- **Pre-Appointed Backup:** [Bank name or specialised servicer] assumes duties immediately upon termination
- **Transition Period:** 10 Business Days for full handover
  - Servicer must provide: IT system access, buyer lists, pending transaction records, inventory locations
  - Backup Servicer completes warm handover procedures (data migration, process training)

**Backup Servicer Duties:**

- Continue vehicle acquisitions (if facility still revolving)
- Execute sales through existing channels (B2B platform, retail)
- Manage collections and remit to Collection Account
- Deliver all required reports to Calculation Agent and noteholders

**Backup Servicer Fees:** Higher than AUTO1 fees (typically +25-50bp premium) to reflect:

- Stand-alone operating costs (no shared services with parent)
- Risk premium for assuming troubled portfolio
- Market rate for third-party servicing

#### **Step 3: Operational Continuity**

**IT Systems:** Backup Servicer must:

- Migrate inventory data to proprietary systems within 30 days
- Maintain operational continuity (no lapse in sales, collections)
- Replicate AUTO1’s buyer network access (or establish alternative channels)

**Performance Deterioration Risk:** Transition to Backup Servicer likely results in:

- **10-20% reduction in sales velocity** (loss of AUTO1’s proprietary buyer network)
- **5-10% margin compression** (Backup Servicer less efficient at pricing)
- **Turn elongation:** 42 days → 55-60 days average hold period

**Mitigation:** Early Amortisation Event (if not already triggered) forces portfolio run-off, reducing reliance on Backup Servicer acquisition/growth activities.

-----

### **8.4 Backup Servicer Failure**

**Scenario:** Backup Servicer is unwilling or unable to assume servicing duties.

**Contingency:**

1. **Security Trustee Direct Management:** Security Trustee appoints receiver to manage portfolio directly

- Receiver has statutory powers under Netherlands law to operate business
- Receiver may engage third-party asset managers (automotive liquidators)

1. **Forced Liquidation:** If no viable servicer available, Security Trustee initiates immediate liquidation

- Portfolio sold in bulk to liquidators (Manheim, BCA, KAR Global)
- Expect **20-30% haircut** to NAV in bulk sale scenario

1. **Early Amortisation / Enforcement:** Servicer failure typically triggers:

- **Early Amortisation Event** (if Backup Servicer unwilling but facility operational)
- **CarCo Enforcement Event** (if Backup Servicer unable and no operational continuity)

**Risk Assessment:** **MEDIUM-LOW** - Backup Servicer is contractually committed; failure would require bilateral insolvency (AUTO1 + Backup Servicer) or market-wide disruption.

-----

### **8.5 Servicing Continuity Risk Mitigation**

**Pre-Closing Requirements:**

- Backup Servicer identified and contractually committed (Backup Servicing Agreement executed)
- Warm handover procedures documented (transition playbook)
- Annual testing of Backup Servicer readiness (mock transition exercises)

**Ongoing Monitoring:**

- Quarterly Servicer performance reviews (KPIs: turn velocity, margin, remittance timeliness)
- Annual financial health assessment of AUTO1 Group SE (credit analysis by Security Trustee)
- Backup Servicer annual certification (confirms continued willingness and ability)

**Noteholder Protections:**

- Majority Noteholder consent required for Servicer replacement (beyond pre-approved Backup)
- Servicer termination fees (payable to AUTO1 if terminated without cause)
- Indemnification from Servicer for breaches causing losses

-----

## **9. CONCLUSION AND KEY RISKS**

### **9.1 Structural Strengths**

**✓ Robust Credit Enhancement:**

- 8.5% senior OC + EUR 40m reserves = strong first loss absorption
- Three-tier subordination with clear waterfall priorities
- Performance-based triggers (BB coverage, CTM) ensure early intervention

**✓ High-Quality Collateral:**

- Core inventory: 2-3 year old German premium brands (VW/BMW/Merc)
- Fast turn (42 days) limits market risk exposure
- Strong historical margins (6.7% gross) provide excess spread cushion

**✓ Experienced Servicer:**

- AUTO1 is market leader with proprietary B2B platform
- Proven track record (4+ years of warehouse operations)
- Backup Servicer provides continuity protection

-----

### **9.2 Key Risks for Senior Noteholders**

**⚠ Concentration Risks:**

- 60% Germany exposure (single-country recession risk)
- VW at 14.8% (near 15% limit; constrains growth flexibility)
- 84% in top 10 makes (limited diversification)

**⚠ Market Risks:**

- Used car prices volatile (COVID spike, now normalising)
- Electric vehicle transition disrupting ICE residual values
- Regulatory risk (emissions standards, export restrictions)

**⚠ Operational Risks:**

- Aged inventory at 6.8% (**breach** of 5% covenant)
- Servicer criticality (AUTO1 replacement would cause performance deterioration)
- Portfolio growth required to support EUR 1,150m senior upsize

**⚠ Structural Risks:**

- Junior cure right (NIFA 6.2/7.2) delays enforcement in distress
- Mezz BB shortfall (EUR 47m currently) indicates tight leverage
- CTM trigger (5%) not binding (provides minimal constraint on growth)

-----

### **9.3 Recommendation**

**SUBJECT TO:**

1. ✓ Remediation plan for aged inventory >5% (target: <4.5% within 60 days)
1. ✓ Commitment to EUR 400m+ inventory growth to support senior upsize
1. ✓ Clarification of junior cure mechanics (seniors retain enforcement rights)
1. ✓ Enhanced reporting post-cure (weekly BBRs if cure occurs)

**The 7th Amendment upsizing Senior Notes to EUR 1,150m is acceptable** with the protections outlined above.
