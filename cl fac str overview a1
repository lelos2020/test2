# **FACILITY STRUCTURE**

-----

## **1. TRANSACTION OVERVIEW**

### **1.1 Structure Summary**

AUTO1 FT1 B.V. (”**CarCo**” or the “**Borrower**”) operates a revolving warehouse facility secured by a pool of wholesale automotive inventory sourced across EMEA. The facility employs a three-tier capital structure issued through a bankruptcy-remote SPV (AUTO1 Funding 1 B.V., the “**Issuer**”) to institutional noteholders:

|**Class**          |**Current Outstanding**|**7th Amendment Commitment**|**Margin**    |**Advance Rate**|**Legal Final Maturity**|
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|
|**Senior Notes**   |EUR 875m               |**EUR 1,150m**              |E+125bp       |91.5% of NAV    |31 Aug 2028             |
|**Mezzanine Notes**|EUR 130m               |EUR 150m                    |E+350bp       |95.0% of NAV    |31 Aug 2028             |
|**Junior Notes**   |~EUR 50m               |Accordion                   |12.00% (fixed)|100.0% of NAV   |42 months post-closing  |

**Proposed Amendment:** 7th Amendment increases Senior Note commitment from EUR 875m to **EUR 1,150m** (+EUR 275m / +31.4%), with corresponding adjustments to borrowing base mechanics and reserve sizing.

**Collateral:** Eligible automotive inventory purchased by CarCo from auctions, dealers, and direct sellers across Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. Vehicles are held for an average of **42 days** before sale to B2B buyers (independent dealers, exporters) or retail consumers via [AUTO1.com](http://AUTO1.com) platform.

**Originator / Servicer:** AUTO1 Group SE acts as Operating Agent and Servicer. CarCo is a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote subsidiary ringfenced from AUTO1 Group’s broader operations.

**Security Package:**

- First-ranking security over CarCo’s inventory (vehicles, receivables, collection accounts)
- Assignment of intercompany receivables
- Share pledge over CarCo
- Account pledges (Collection Account, Reserve Accounts)

**Rating Agency Coverage:** Moody’s and Scope Ratings provide surveillance ratings on Senior and Mezzanine Notes.

-----

## **2. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT**

### **2.1 Structural Credit Enhancement**

**A. Subordination**

The facility benefits from a **three-tier waterfall** with structural subordination protecting senior creditors:

```
BORROWING BASE MECHANICS:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Eligible Inventory (Net Adjusted Value):        EUR 845.1m (Base: 96.8% of cost)

Senior Note Advance Rate:      91.5%      →    EUR 773.3m capacity
Senior Overcollateralisation:   8.5%      →    EUR 71.8m cushion

Mezzanine Incremental:          3.5%      →    EUR 29.6m incremental capacity  
Mezzanine Total AR:            95.0%      →    EUR 802.9m capacity
Mezzanine Overcollateralisation: 5.0%     →    EUR 42.3m cushion (senior + mezz)

Junior Residual:                5.0%      →    EUR 42.2m residual equity
Junior "Advance Rate":        100.0%      →    EUR 845.1m (full NAV)

TOTAL REQUIRED OVERCOLLATERALISATION: 8.5% (senior) + 5.0% (combined) = 13.5% minimum equity cushion
```

**Senior Protection:** Senior notes are first loss remote by **8.5%** initial overcollateralisation, providing absorption capacity for:

- Portfolio value deterioration (market value decline, aged inventory markdowns)
- Concentration limit breaches (excess amounts excluded from borrowing base)
- Operational losses (vehicles damaged, stolen, or unsaleable)

**B. Reserve Accounts**

Three segregated reserve accounts provide additional liquidity protection:

|**Reserve Account**  |**Required Amount**                                     |**Purpose**                                      |**Release Conditions**                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|**Senior Reserve**   |Greater of: (a) EUR 25m, or (b) 3.5% of Senior Notes O/S|Cover senior interest shortfalls, BB deficiencies|Pro rata release upon senior note amortisation|
|**Mezzanine Reserve**|Greater of: (a) EUR 5m, or (b) 3.5% of Mezz Notes O/S   |Cover mezz interest shortfalls, BB deficiencies  |Pro rata release upon mezz note amortisation  |
|**Trade Tax Reserve**|EUR 2.5m (fixed)                                        |German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) contingency     |Released post-maturity if no tax liability    |

**Current Reserve Levels (Assumed):**

- Senior Reserve: EUR 30.6m (3.5% × EUR 875m)
- Mezzanine Reserve: EUR 4.6m (3.5% × EUR 130m)
- Trade Tax Reserve: EUR 2.5m
- **Total Reserves:** EUR 37.7m

**Post-7th Amendment Reserve Requirement:**

- Senior Reserve: EUR 40.3m (3.5% × EUR 1,150m) → **+EUR 9.7m increase**
- Mezzanine Reserve: EUR 5.3m (3.5% × EUR 150m)
- Trade Tax Reserve: EUR 2.5m
- **Total Reserves:** EUR 48.1m → **+EUR 10.4m incremental funding required**

**Trapped Cash:** Reserve accounts are **non-recourse** to AUTO1 Group and rank senior to all noteholder payments except senior interest and mandatory redemptions.

-----

### **2.2 Performance-Based Credit Enhancement**

**A. Excess Spread**

Historical **net cash trading margin** of ~4.2% (gross margin 6.7%, less operating expenses 2.5%) generates significant excess spread available to:

- Cover credit losses on aged/damaged inventory
- Fund reserve account build
- Amortise notes during controlled run-off

**Stress Testing:**

- **Base Case (6.7% margin):** Covers 6.2x annual interest expense → Strong excess spread coverage
- **Stress Case (4.5% margin):** Covers 4.1x annual interest → Adequate but compressed
- **Severe Stress (2.0% margin):** Covers 1.8x annual interest → Minimal coverage; early amortisation triggered

**B. Cash Trapping (Early Amortisation)**

Upon breach of performance triggers (see Section 5), the facility enters **Early Amortisation**, redirecting excess cash from portfolio growth to **mandatory note amortisation**:

**Pre-Early Amortisation Waterfall:**

- Priorities 1-8: Fees, interest, reserves
- Priority 9-12: Mandatory prepayments (BB compliance)
- Priority 13-14: **Junior notes interest/principal** (if no senior EoD)
- **Residual:** Available for new advances (portfolio growth)

**Post-Early Amortisation Waterfall:**

- Priorities 1-8: Fees, interest, reserves
- Priority 9: **Senior notes principal (sequential amortisation)**
- Priority 10: **Mezzanine notes principal (sequential amortisation)**
- Priority 11-12: Junior notes (if seniors/mezz paid in full)
- **Residual:** Minimal; facility winds down

**Effect:** Early Amortisation converts facility from revolving to term-out, de-leveraging the structure and protecting senior noteholders from deteriorating portfolio quality.

-----

### **2.3 Collateral Quality Enhancement**

**A. Eligibility Criteria (Hard Exclusions)**

Vehicles must satisfy all criteria to be included in borrowing base (see Section 3 for detail):

- Purchase price: EUR 2,000 - EUR 75,000
- Model year: ≤ 10 years old at purchase
- Mileage: ≤ 250,000 km
- No salvage title, major accident damage, or outstanding recalls
- Located in Eligible Jurisdiction
- Not subject to third-party lien or encumbrance

**Current Eligibility Rate:** ~94.5% of total inventory → 5.5% excluded for age, price, damage, or jurisdictional reasons.

**B. Concentration Limits (Portfolio Diversification)**

Hard limits prevent over-concentration in any single risk factor (see Section 4 for detail):

- **Single OEM:** Max 15% of borrowing base (e.g., Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes)
- **Single Country:** Max 65% (Germany concentration limit)
- **Aged Inventory:** Max 5% of vehicles held >90 days

**Breaches:** Excess amounts are **excluded from borrowing base** and do not contribute to advance rate calculation, creating automatic deleveraging.

-----

## **3. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**

### **3.1 Vehicle-Level Eligibility Requirements**

A vehicle is “**Eligible**” for inclusion in the borrowing base only if it satisfies **all** of the following criteria on the relevant Borrowing Base Test Date:

#### **A. Purchase Price**

|**Criterion**|**Threshold**|**Rationale**                                             |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|Minimum      |EUR 2,000    |Excludes scrap/salvage vehicles; ensures minimum liquidity|
|Maximum      |EUR 75,000   |Limits exposure to luxury segment with thin resale market |

**Current Portfolio:** Weighted average purchase price EUR 19,312; 98.7% of vehicles fall within EUR 10k-35k range.

#### **B. Age and Vintage**

|**Criterion**          |**Threshold**                                |**Rationale**                                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|Maximum Age at Purchase|10 years (120 months from first registration)|Older vehicles face rapid depreciation, mechanical risk|
|Excluded Vintages      |Pre-2015 model year (as of 2025)             |Aligns with 10-year lookback                           |

**Current Portfolio:** Weighted average vintage 2.3 years old; 88% are 2020 or newer models.

#### **C. Mileage**

|**Criterion**   |**Threshold**|**Rationale**                                                   |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Maximum Odometer|250,000 km   |High-mileage vehicles face mechanical issues, lower resale value|

**Current Portfolio:** Weighted average mileage ~65,000 km; 96% under 150,000 km.

#### **D. Title and Legal Status**

- **Clean Title:** No salvage, rebuilt, or flood damage designation
- **No Outstanding Recalls:** All safety recalls cleared or vehicle sold “as-is” with disclosure
- **No Third-Party Liens:** CarCo must hold unencumbered legal title
- **Registered Ownership:** Vehicle must be registered in CarCo’s name (or in transit with bill of sale)

**Verification:** Operating Agent conducts title searches via national registries (KBA in Germany, RDW in Netherlands, etc.) prior to funding.

#### **E. Geographic Eligibility**

Vehicle must be **physically located** in an Eligible Jurisdiction:

- ✓ Austria
- ✓ Belgium
- ✓ France
- ✓ Germany (primary market)
- ✓ Italy (subject to Italian Cut-Off Date and legal opinions)
- ✓ Netherlands
- ✓ Poland
- ✓ Spain
- ✗ **Sweden** (excluded from 30 June 2021)
- ✗ Other jurisdictions (require Majority Senior Noteholder consent)

**Rationale:** Limits enforcement risk to jurisdictions with established AUTO1 buyer networks and clear security perfection.

#### **F. Condition and Operability**

- **Driveable:** Vehicle must be in running condition (excludes non-runners, major mechanical failure)
- **No Major Damage:** Excludes vehicles with frame damage, flood exposure, or fire damage
- **Commercially Saleable:** Must be marketable to wholesale buyers without material repair

**Inspection:** AUTO1’s acquisition teams conduct 150-point inspections; any vehicle failing inspection is classified as **Non-Eligible** and funded via junior notes or equity.

#### **G. Time-Based Eligibility**

- **Maximum Days on Book:** 90 days from purchase date
- **Aged Inventory Concentration:** If vehicles >90 days exceed 5% of total inventory, oldest vehicles are excluded until concentration falls below 5%

**Current Status:** 6.8% of vehicles aged >90 days → **Covenant breach** (see Section 6.2).

-----

### **3.2 Ineligibility Event Mechanics**

**Real-Time Monitoring:** Calculation Agent tracks eligibility daily via Operating Agent reports. Upon ineligibility event:

**Step 1: Immediate Exclusion**

- Vehicle is **removed from borrowing base** on the next Borrowing Base Test Date
- Net Adjusted Value is reduced by vehicle’s NAV
- Advance rate is recalculated

**Step 2: Borrowing Base Shortfall Test**

```
IF: New BB Value < Notes Outstanding
THEN: Borrowing Base Shortfall = Notes O/S - BB Value
ACTION: CarCo must prepay shortfall amount by next Utilisation Business Day
```

**Step 3: Remediation Options**
CarCo may cure ineligibility by:

- **Option A:** Selling the ineligible vehicle and using proceeds to prepay notes
- **Option B:** Adding new eligible vehicles to restore BB Value
- **Option C:** Junior noteholder injects cure capital (per NIFA 6.2/7.2)

**Step 4: Failure to Cure**
If shortfall not cured within required timeframe:

- **Senior/Mezz Shortfall:** Event of Default (non-payment) after 10 BD grace period
- **Repeated Shortfalls:** Potential Early Amortisation Event trigger

-----

### **3.3 Eligibility Verification Process**

**Daily Reporting:** Operating Agent delivers Borrowing Base Certificate to Calculation Agent by 12:00 CET each Utilisation Business Day, certifying:

- Vehicle-level eligibility status (VIN-by-VIN)
- Aggregate Eligible Inventory value
- Concentration limit compliance
- Ageing bucket distribution

**Bi-Weekly Formal Reporting:** Full Borrowing Base Report delivered to Senior Agents on each Settlement Date (every 14 days), including:

- Detailed vehicle inventory stratification
- Eligibility exclusions with reasons
- Historical trend analysis (turn velocity, margin realization)
- Covenant compliance certificates

**Annual Audit:** Independent auditor (Big 4 accounting firm) conducts annual review of:

- Eligibility criteria application consistency
- Title/lien searches (sample-based)
- Collateral existence verification (physical inspections)

-----

## **4. CONCENTRATION LIMITS**

### **4.1 Overview and Rationale**

Concentration limits prevent **single-name risk** and ensure portfolio diversification across OEMs, geographies, and vehicle segments. Excess amounts above limits are **excluded from Net Adjusted Value**, creating automatic deleveraging upon breach.

### **4.2 OEM / Make Concentration**

**Single Make Limit: 15% of Eligible Inventory Value**

|**Make**     |**Illustrative Portfolio %**|**Limit**|**Headroom**|**Commentary**                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------|---------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
|Volkswagen   |14.8%                       |15.0%    |0.2%        |**TIGHT** - Minimal capacity to add VW inventory|
|BMW          |11.2%                       |15.0%    |3.8%        |Adequate headroom                               |
|Mercedes-Benz|10.9%                       |15.0%    |4.1%        |Adequate headroom                               |
|Audi         |9.7%                        |15.0%    |5.3%        |Comfortable                                     |
|Ford         |8.3%                        |15.0%    |6.7%        |Comfortable                                     |
|Others       |<15% each                   |15.0%    |Varies      |Compliant                                       |

**Calculation Methodology:**

```
Make Concentration % = (NAV of Make X vehicles) / (Total Eligible Inventory NAV)

IF: Make X > 15%
THEN: Excess Amount = (Make X NAV) - (15% × Total NAV)
ACTION: Exclude Excess Amount from BB calculation
```

**Example:**

```
Volkswagen NAV:           EUR 125.0m
Total Eligible NAV:       EUR 845.1m
VW Concentration:         14.8% (compliant)

If VW increased to:       EUR 130.0m
VW Concentration:         15.4% (breach)
Excess Amount:            EUR 130.0m - (15% × EUR 845.1m) = EUR 3.2m
Adjusted VW NAV:          EUR 126.8m (capped at 15%)
```

**Remediation:** CarCo must either (a) sell excess VW inventory, or (b) add non-VW inventory to dilute VW concentration below 15%.

-----

### **4.3 Geographic Concentration**

**Single Country Limit: 65% of Eligible Inventory Value** (Germany-specific)

|**Country**|**Illustrative Portfolio %**|**Limit**        |**Status**               |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
|Germany    |60.0%                       |65.0%            |✓ Compliant (5% headroom)|
|France     |17.0%                       |No specific limit|✓                        |
|Poland     |10.0%                       |No specific limit|✓                        |
|Spain      |7.0%                        |No specific limit|✓                        |
|Italy      |5.0%                        |No specific limit|✓                        |
|Others     |1.0%                        |No specific limit|✓                        |

**Rationale:** Germany represents AUTO1’s core market with deepest liquidity, justifying higher concentration tolerance. Limit prevents over-reliance on single-country economic conditions.

**Risk Consideration:** 60% Germany concentration creates material exposure to German used car market cycles, GDP growth, and consumer confidence. Stress testing should model German-specific recession scenario.

-----

### **4.4 Vintage Concentration**

**No explicit hard limit**, but Operating Agent targets:

- **Current year (2025):** <10% (avoids high depreciation risk)
- **1-3 years old (2022-2024):** 60-70% (core inventory)
- **4-5 years old (2020-2021):** 15-25% (value segment)
- **6+ years old (pre-2020):** <5% (aged inventory management)

**Current Distribution Aligns with Targets:** Weighted average vintage 2.3 years old.

-----

### **4.5 Aged Inventory Concentration**

**Hard Limit: 5% of Eligible Inventory Units**

**Current Status:**

- Vehicles >90 days on book: **6.8% of eligible units**
- **Status: BREACH** (1.8% above limit)

**Calculation:**

```
Aged Inventory % = (# of vehicles >90 days) / (Total eligible vehicles)

Current: 3,078 aged vehicles / 45,234 eligible = 6.8%
Limit: 5.0%
Excess: 1.8% or ~814 vehicles
```

**Action Required:**

- CarCo must sell or otherwise remove 814 vehicles from eligible inventory
- OR increase total eligible inventory to dilute aged concentration below 5%
- Failure to cure within covenant cure period triggers **Early Amortisation Event**

**Loss Implications:**

- Aged inventory (>90 days) realizes average **13% loss** vs. purchase price
- If 814 vehicles @ EUR 19k avg = EUR 15.5m exposure
- Expected loss: EUR 15.5m × 13% = **EUR 2.0m** potential write-down

-----

### **4.6 Purchase Price Concentration**

**No explicit hard limits**, but Internal Risk Guidelines target:

- **EUR 0-10k:** <15% (sub-prime quality risk)
- **EUR 10-20k:** 40-60% (core inventory)
- **EUR 20-35k:** 25-40% (premium segment)
- **EUR 35k+:** <10% (luxury illiquidity risk)

**Current Distribution Complies:** 65% in EUR 10-25k range; weighted average EUR 19.3k.

-----

### **4.7 Excess Amount Treatment**

**Waterfall Application:**

When concentration limits are breached, excess amounts are:

1. **Excluded from Net Adjusted Value** in borrowing base calculation
1. **Not eligible for advance rate application** (cannot borrow against excess)
1. **Treated as non-eligible inventory** for covenant compliance purposes
1. **Must be liquidated or diluted** to restore compliance

**Priority for Exclusion (Operating Agent discretion):**

- Oldest vehicles in excess category excluded first
- Lowest margin vehicles excluded second
- Vehicles with mechanical issues excluded third

**Financial Impact Example:**

```
Base Case (No Breach):
  Eligible Inventory NAV:      EUR 845.1m
  Senior AR (91.5%):            EUR 773.3m capacity

Concentration Breach (VW excess EUR 3.2m):
  Adjusted Eligible NAV:        EUR 841.9m (EUR 845.1m - EUR 3.2m)
  Senior AR (91.5%):            EUR 770.3m capacity
  Capacity Loss:                EUR 3.0m ← immediate deleveraging
```

-----

## **5. PERFORMANCE TRIGGERS**

### **5.1 Early Amortisation Events**

**Early Amortisation** converts the facility from revolving to sequential amortisation, redirecting excess spread from portfolio growth to mandatory note repayment. The following events trigger Early Amortisation:

#### **A. Cash Trading Margin Breach**

**Trigger:** Cash Trading Margin < **5.0%** on any Settlement Date

**Definition:**

```
Cash Trading Margin = (Available Liquidity) / (Total Eligible Inventory Value)

Where:
  Available Liquidity = Cash in Collection Account
                      + Undrawn Senior Note Commitment
                      - Minimum Operating Balance (EUR 10m)
                      - Pending Settlement Payables
  
  Total Eligible Inventory = NAV of all eligible vehicles
```

**Illustrative Calculation (Current - Compliant):**

```
Collection Account Balance:         EUR 64.2m
Undrawn Senior Commitment:          EUR 430.0m (EUR 1,150m - EUR 720m O/S)
Less: Min Operating Balance:        (EUR 10.0m)
Less: Pending Payables:             (EUR 18.3m)
Available Liquidity:                EUR 465.9m

Total Eligible Inventory:           EUR 873.2m

Cash Trading Margin:                53.4% ✓ PASS (48.4% cushion)
```

**Stress Scenario (5% Trigger Level):**

```
For CTM to hit 5%:
  Required Liquidity = 5% × Inventory
  
If Inventory grows to:              EUR 1,800m
Required Liquidity:                 EUR 90m
Available Liquidity:                EUR 465.9m (assuming same undrawn)
Calculated CTM:                     25.9% ✓ Still compliant

Conclusion: CTM trigger is NOT BINDING under realistic growth scenarios
           Facility can support 2x inventory growth before CTM breach
```

**Risk Assessment:** **LOW** - Trigger provides minimal constraint; not expected to activate absent severe liquidity stress.

-----

#### **B. Borrowing Base Coverage Test**

**Senior Note Trigger:** Senior BB Value < **100%** of Senior Notes Outstanding

**Calculation:**

```
Senior BB Coverage = (Senior BB Value) / (Senior Notes O/S)

Where:
  Senior BB Value = Eligible Inventory NAV × 91.5%
```

**Current Status (Post-7th Amendment Assumed):**

```
Eligible Inventory NAV:             EUR 845.1m
Senior BB Value:                    EUR 773.3m (91.5% × EUR 845.1m)
Senior Notes O/S:                   EUR 720.0m (current) or EUR 1,150m (proposed)

Current Coverage:                   107.4% ✓ PASS
Post-Amendment Coverage:            67.2% ✗ **FAIL** if drawn to EUR 1,150m
```

**CRITICAL OBSERVATION:**

- **If Senior Notes drawn to full EUR 1,150m commitment, BB shortfall = EUR 376.7m**
- **CarCo would need to:**
  - Add EUR 412m of new eligible inventory (EUR 376.7m ÷ 91.5% AR), OR
  - Prepay EUR 376.7m of senior notes immediately

**Implication:** 7th Amendment upsize assumes **portfolio growth to EUR 1.45bn+** to support full senior commitment drawdown.

**Mezzanine Note Trigger:** Mezz BB Value < **100%** of (Senior + Mezz) Notes Outstanding

**Current Status (Illustrative):**

```
Eligible Inventory NAV:             EUR 845.1m  
Mezz BB Value:                      EUR 802.9m (95% × EUR 845.1m)
Senior + Mezz Notes O/S:            EUR 850.0m (EUR 720m + EUR 130m)

Mezzanine Coverage:                 94.5% ✗ **FAIL** (EUR 47.1m shortfall)
```

**Action Required:**

- CarCo must prepay EUR 47.1m of mezzanine notes by next Utilisation Business Day, OR
- Add EUR 49.6m of new eligible inventory to restore BB Value

**Frequency:** BB coverage tested **bi-weekly** on each Settlement Date.

-----

#### **C. Reserve Account Deficiency**

**Trigger:** Reserve Accounts < Required Amounts on any Settlement Date (after waterfall application)

**Required Amounts:**

- **Senior Reserve:** Greater of (a) EUR 25m, or (b) 3.5% of Senior Notes O/S
- **Mezzanine Reserve:** Greater of (a) EUR 5m, or (b) 3.5% of Mezz Notes O/S
- **Trade Tax Reserve:** EUR 2.5m (fixed)

**Grace Period:** 10 Business Days to cure deficiency via:

- Collections reinvestment (diverted from portfolio growth)
- Junior note issuance (cure capital injection)
- Note prepayment (reducing required reserve amount)

**Current Compliance:** **ASSUMED COMPLIANT** (reserves fully funded at EUR 37.7m).

**Post-7th Amendment:** Required senior reserve increases to EUR 40.3m (+EUR 9.7m).

-----

#### **D. Covenant Breach Events**

**See Section 6 for detail.** Key covenant breaches that trigger Early Amortisation:

- Financial covenants (e.g., minimum net worth, leverage ratios) - **NOT APPLICABLE** (CarCo is SPV with no financial covenants)
- Operational covenants (e.g., portfolio quality metrics):
  - Aged Inventory >5% for >30 days (currently **BREACHED** at 6.8%)
  - Concentration limits exceeded and not cured within 15 BD

-----

#### **E. Servicer Events**

**See Section 8 for detail.** Servicer Termination Events include:

- Servicer insolvency
- Material breach of servicing obligations
- Fraud or gross negligence
- Failure to remit collections within 2 BD

Upon Servicer Termination, **Back-Up Servicer** (pre-appointed) assumes servicing duties. If Back-Up Servicer unavailable or unwilling, **Early Amortisation Event** occurs.

-----

### **5.2 Enforcement Events**

More severe than Early Amortisation; triggers **immediate acceleration** and **Security Trustee enforcement**.

#### **CarCo Enforcement Event**

**Trigger Events:**

1. **CarCo Insolvency:** Filing for bankruptcy, insolvency, or analogous proceeding
1. **Non-Payment:** Failure to pay principal or interest after 15 BD grace period
1. **Material Breach:** Breach of representations, warranties, or covenants (if not cured within 30 days)
1. **Cross-Default:** Default under other material indebtedness (>EUR 10m)

**Action Upon Enforcement:**

- Security Trustee delivers **CarCo Enforcement Notice**
- All commitments immediately cancelled
- All notes become immediately due and payable
- Security Trustee assumes control of Collection Account
- **Post-Enforcement Waterfall** applies:
  - Priority 1-4: Fees, senior interest, senior principal
  - Priority 5-6: Fees, mezz interest, mezz principal
  - Priority 7-8: Junior interest, junior principal

**Enforcement Powers:**

- Appoint Receiver over CarCo Charged Property
- Liquidate inventory (forced sales to approved buyers)
- Assign servicing to third party
- Pursue legal recourse against Operating Agent (if fraud/gross negligence)

#### **Issuer Enforcement Event**

**Trigger Events:**

1. **Issuer Insolvency:** Bankruptcy filing by AUTO1 Funding 1 B.V.
1. **Non-Payment (Pre-Maturity):** Failure to pay senior/mezz interest or principal (5 BD grace)
1. **Non-Payment (Maturity):** Failure to pay any note on Final Maturity Date (no grace period)
1. **Material Breach:** Breach of Issuer covenants (30 day cure period)

**Majority Noteholder Control:** Upon Issuer Event of Default, **Majority Senior Noteholders** (>66 2/3%) may instruct Security Trustee to deliver Issuer Enforcement Notice.

**Effect:** Similar to CarCo Enforcement; immediate acceleration, enforcement waterfall, liquidation.

-----

### **5.3 Trigger Monitoring and Reporting**

**Daily Monitoring (Internal):**

- Operating Agent tracks BB coverage, concentration limits, eligibility compliance
- Real-time alerts if triggers approach (e.g., BB coverage <105%)

**Bi-Weekly Formal Certification:**

- Calculation Agent delivers **Trigger Compliance Certificate** on each Settlement Date
- Certifies compliance with all triggers and covenants
- Flags any breaches or imminent breaches (within 5% of trigger level)

**Monthly Reporting to Lenders:**

- Summary dashboard: BB coverage, CTM, reserve balances, concentration heat map
- Trend analysis: historical trigger metrics (12-month lookback)
- Forward-looking projections: stress scenarios (10% inventory markdown, 60-day turn elongation)

**Quarterly Investor Calls:**

- Senior Noteholders invited to join quarterly update calls with AUTO1 management
- Discussion of portfolio performance, market conditions, strategic initiatives
- Q&A session for lender concerns

-----

## **6. COVENANTS**

### **6.1 Affirmative Covenants (CarCo)**

CarCo must:

#### **A. Financial Reporting**

|**Report**                 |**Frequency**              |**Delivery Deadline**  |**Content**                                             |

-----

### **6.3 Covenants - Operating Agent / Servicer**

AUTO1 Group SE, as Operating Agent and Servicer, must:

#### **A. Servicing Standards**

- Service portfolio in accordance with **Servicing Standard** (defined as level of care exercised by AUTO1 for its proprietary inventory)
- Maintain all required licenses and permits (dealer licenses, auction memberships)
- Comply with consumer protection laws (price transparency, warranty disclosures)
- Maintain errors and omissions insurance (EUR 5m coverage)

#### **B. Collections Management**

- Remit 100% of collections to Collection Account within **2 Business Days** of receipt
- No commingling of CarCo collections with AUTO1 Group funds
- Maintain sub-ledgers identifying each collection by vehicle VIN
- Reconcile collections daily (actual cash vs. expected proceeds)

#### **C. Reporting and Record-Keeping**

- Maintain complete servicing records (purchase contracts, sale agreements, inspection reports)
- Provide Calculation Agent access to records upon request (5 BD notice)
- Deliver monthly servicing reports (delinquencies, losses, aged inventory actions)
- Maintain IT systems with disaster recovery (RPO: 24 hours, RTO: 48 hours)

#### **D. No Material Adverse Change**

- Notify Security Trustee immediately of any **Material Adverse Effect** affecting:
  - AUTO1 Group’s financial condition (e.g., liquidity crisis, going concern doubt)
  - AUTO1 Group’s ability to perform servicing obligations
  - Validity or enforceability of Transaction Documents

-----

### **6.4 Financial Covenants (AUTO1 Group SE)**

While CarCo has **no financial covenants** (as an SPV), AUTO1 Group SE (parent guarantor for servicing obligations) must maintain:

#### **A. Minimum Liquidity**

- Maintain unrestricted cash and undrawn committed facilities ≥ **EUR 100m** at consolidated level
- Tested quarterly
- Breach triggers mandatory reporting and potential Servicer review

#### **B. Tangible Net Worth**

- Maintain consolidated tangible net worth ≥ **EUR 300m**
- Tested quarterly
- Adjusted for intangibles (goodwill, brand value) and subordinated debt

#### **C. Interest Coverage**

- Maintain consolidated EBITDA / Interest Expense ≥ **2.0x**
- Tested quarterly (rolling 4-quarter basis)
- Excludes non-cash charges (depreciation, stock-based compensation)

**Rationale:** Ensures AUTO1 Group remains financially viable to perform servicing obligations. Breach of financial covenants triggers **Servicer Review Event** (not automatic termination), allowing noteholders to assess remediation plans.

-----

### **6.5 Covenant Breach Cure Mechanics**

#### **Step 1: Notice of Breach**

- CarCo or Servicer must notify Security Trustee within **5 Business Days** of becoming aware of breach
- Security Trustee notifies all Noteholders within **2 Business Days**

#### **Step 2: Cure Period**

|**Covenant Type**              |**Cure Period**              |**Permitted Cure Actions**                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|**Borrowing Base Shortfall**   |Next Utilisation Business Day|Add inventory, prepay notes, junior cure capital|
|**Reserve Deficiency**         |10 Business Days             |Divert collections, issue junior notes          |
|**Aged Inventory >5%**         |30 calendar days             |Liquidate aged units, grow eligible inventory   |
|**Concentration Breach**       |15 Business Days             |Sell excess, dilute with new purchases          |
|**Financial Covenants (AUTO1)**|30 calendar days             |Equity injection, asset sales, debt refinancing |

#### **Step 3: Failure to Cure**

If breach not cured within cure period:

- **Minor Covenants:** Trigger Early Amortisation Event (cash trap, no new advances)
- **Material Covenants:** Trigger Event of Default (immediate acceleration, enforcement)

**Majority Noteholder Waiver:**

- Breaches may be **waived** by Majority Senior Noteholders (>66 2/3%)
- Waiver must be in writing and may include conditions (e.g., fees, pricing step-up)
- One-time waivers typical; repeated waivers require structural amendment

-----

## **7. EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

### **7.1 CarCo Events of Default**

The following events constitute an Event of Default under the Loan Agreements:

#### **A. Non-Payment**

**Trigger:** Failure to pay principal, interest, or fees when due

**Grace Period:**

- **Principal:** 15 Business Days
- **Interest:** 10 Business Days (5 BD if on Maturity Date)
- **Fees:** 15 Business Days

**Rationale for Grace Period:** Allows time for administrative errors (payment processing delays) to be corrected; prevents technical defaults from operational glitches.

**Cure Mechanism:** Non-payment cured if:

- Amount paid in full within grace period, **AND**
- Junior noteholder has NOT injected cure capital (per NIFA 6.2/7.2)
  - If juniors cure, grace period clock resets; seniors may still enforce if fundamental issue exists

**Current Risk Assessment:** **LOW** - CarCo has consistent positive cash flow from trading operations; no historical non-payments.

-----

#### **B. Breach of Covenants**

**Trigger:** Failure to comply with any covenant under Transaction Documents

**Cure Period:**

- **Borrowing Base Certificate delivery:** 5 Business Days
- **Financial reporting:** 15 Business Days
- **Other covenants:** 30 calendar days

**Exceptions (No Cure Period):**

- Bankruptcy remoteness covenants (immediate EoD)
- Fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct (immediate EoD)
- Repeated breaches of same covenant (>3 times in 12 months = immediate EoD)

-----

#### **C. Misrepresentation**

**Trigger:** Any representation or warranty proves materially false when made

**Cure Period:** **30 days** if capable of remedy

**Examples:**

- **Curable:** “All vehicles have clean title” → One vehicle has undisclosed lien (can be removed)
- **Incurable:** “CarCo has no undisclosed litigation” → Material litigation exists (cannot undo)

**Materiality Threshold:** Misrepresentation must be **material** to trigger EoD:

- Affects >5% of borrowing base value, OR
- Impairs Security Trustee’s security interest, OR
- Relates to financial condition having Material Adverse Effect

-----

#### **D. Cross-Default**

**Trigger:** Default under other **Material Indebtedness** of CarCo

**Definition of Material Indebtedness:**

- Outstanding amount >**EUR 10,000,000**, OR
- Indebtedness that, if accelerated, would have Material Adverse Effect on CarCo’s ability to perform obligations

**Scope:** Captures defaults under:

- Hedging agreements (if notional >EUR 10m)
- Leases or equipment financing (if aggregate >EUR 10m)
- **NOT applicable to AUTO1 Group debt** (separate legal entity; non-recourse)

**Current Exposure:** **NIL** - CarCo has no material indebtedness outside Transaction Documents.

-----

#### **E. Insolvency**

**Trigger:** Any of the following with respect to CarCo:

- Filing of insolvency, bankruptcy, or analogous proceeding
- Appointment of receiver, administrator, or trustee
- Admission of inability to pay debts as they fall due
- Suspension of payments to creditors generally

**No Cure Period:** Insolvency Events trigger **immediate** Event of Default.

**Bankruptcy Remoteness Protections:**

- Independent director (no affiliation to AUTO1 Group) holds “Golden Share”
- Golden Share holder must consent to any insolvency filing
- Independent director has fiduciary duty to creditors (not AUTO1 shareholders)

**Risk Mitigation:** Structural protections make CarCo insolvency highly unlikely absent fraud or legal challenge to SPV structure.

-----

#### **F. Material Adverse Effect**

**Trigger:** Occurrence of event having **Material Adverse Effect** on:

- CarCo’s business or financial condition, OR
- Validity or enforceability of Transaction Documents, OR
- Security Trustee’s security interest in CarCo Charged Property

**Cure Period:** **30 days** if capable of remedy

**Examples:**

- **MAE on business:** German government bans used car exports (40% of AUTO1’s buyers are exporters)
- **MAE on enforceability:** Netherlands court rules CarCo security structure unenforceable
- **MAE on security:** Government confiscates inventory (war, expropriation)

**Subjectivity:** “Material Adverse Effect” is intentionally broad; interpretation depends on facts and circumstances. Majority Noteholders have discretion to declare EoD.

-----

#### **G. Unlawfulness**

**Trigger:** It becomes unlawful for CarCo to perform obligations under Transaction Documents

**Examples:**

- Sanctions prohibit lending to AUTO1-affiliated entities
- Regulatory change prohibits securitisation structure
- Tax law change renders structure non-viable

**Mandatory Prepayment:** Upon illegality, CarCo must prepay all notes (subject to available funds and Priority of Payments).

-----

### **7.2 Issuer Events of Default**

The following events constitute an Issuer Event of Default:

#### **A. Non-Payment (Pre-Maturity)**

**Trigger:**

- Failure to pay **senior or mezzanine** interest, principal, or fees when due (5 BD grace)
- Failure to pay **senior agents** fees when due (15 BD grace)

**Junior Notes Exception:** Non-payment of junior notes is **NOT** an Issuer Event of Default unless seniors and mezz are fully repaid.

**Grace Period Logic:** 5 BD grace allows time for:

- Collections to clear (T+3 settlement lag)
- Junior cure capital injection (per NIFA 6.2/7.2)
- Administrative error correction

-----

#### **B. Non-Payment (Maturity Date)**

**Trigger:** Failure to pay **any note** on Final Maturity Date (31 Aug 2028)

**No Grace Period:** Maturity Date non-payment is immediate EoD.

**Rationale:** By Maturity Date, Issuer has had 4+ years to amortise notes and wind down portfolio. Failure to pay on maturity indicates terminal failure.

-----

#### **C. Reserve Account Deficiency**

**Trigger:** Reserve Accounts below required amounts on any Settlement Date (after waterfall application), not cured within **10 Business Days**

**Deficiency Test:**

```
Required Amount:
  Senior Reserve:    Max(EUR 25m, 3.5% × Senior Notes O/S)
  Mezzanine Reserve: Max(EUR 5m, 3.5% × Mezz Notes O/S)
  Trade Tax Reserve: EUR 2.5m

IF: Actual Balance < Required Amount on Settlement Date
THEN: Issue notice to Issuer and Security Trustee
      10 BD cure period begins

IF: Not cured within 10 BD
THEN: Issuer Event of Default occurs
```

**Cure Mechanics:** Issuer may cure by:

- Diverting future collections to reserve accounts (via waterfall Priority 8)
- Receiving junior cure capital (applied to reserves)
- Reducing note balances (lowers required reserve amount)

-----

#### **D. Breach of Covenants**

**Material Breach:** Failure to perform obligations owed to Senior Noteholders, with **Material Adverse Effect**, not cured within **30 days**

**Securitisation Regulation Compliance:** Failure to comply with Article 7 STS requirements (transparency, simplicity, standardisation), not cured within **6 months**

**Breach of Fundamental Covenants:** Immediate EoD (no cure period):

- Change of COMI outside Netherlands
- Become an Alternative Investment Fund (AIFMD)
- Permit Transaction Security to become invalid or unenforceable (subject to Legal Reservations)

-----

#### **E. Insolvency**

**Trigger:** Issuer (AUTO1 Funding 1 B.V.) files for insolvency or analogous proceeding

**No Cure Period:** Immediate Event of Default.

**Ring-Fencing:** Issuer has same bankruptcy remoteness protections as CarCo (Golden Share, independent director, no business activities outside Transaction Documents).

-----

#### **F. Cross-Defaults (Issuer)**

**Trigger:** CarCo Event of Default under Senior Loan Agreement or Mezzanine Loan Agreement

**Mechanism:**

- CarCo EoD → Lender (Issuer) declares CarCo loans due and payable
- Issuer lacks funds to pay noteholders (CarCo is sole asset)
- Issuer defaults to noteholders → Issuer Event of Default

**Linkage:** Issuer’s obligations are **structurally dependent** on CarCo performance. CarCo failure = Issuer failure.

-----

### **7.3 Remedies Upon Event of Default**

#### **A. Acceleration**

**Majority Noteholder Instruction:** Upon EoD, Majority Senior Noteholders may instruct Security Trustee to:

- Declare all notes immediately due and payable
- Cancel all commitments (no new advances)
- Deliver Enforcement Notice to CarCo/Issuer

**Voting Threshold:**

- **Majority Senior Noteholders:** >66 2/3% of Senior Notes Outstanding Amount
- Excludes Defaulting Noteholders (failed to fund participation)

**Automatic Acceleration:** Certain EoDs trigger automatic acceleration (no instruction required):

- Insolvency of CarCo or Issuer
- Non-payment on Maturity Date
- Fraud or wilful misconduct

-----

#### **B. Enforcement of Security**

Upon delivery of Enforcement Notice, Security Trustee may:

**Immediate Actions:**

- Take control of Collection Account and Reserve Accounts
- Appoint Receiver over CarCo Charged Property
- Direct Operating Agent to cease new vehicle purchases
- Instruct Servicer to liquidate inventory (orderly or forced sale)

**Ongoing Management:**

- Servicer continues servicing under Security Trustee supervision
- If Servicer terminated, Backup Servicer assumes duties
- Collections applied per **Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments**

**Liquidation Strategy:**

- **Orderly Liquidation (Preferred):** Sell vehicles through normal B2B channels over 60-90 days
  - Target: Realise 95-100% of NAV
  - Time: 3-6 months to fully liquidate portfolio
- **Forced Liquidation (Accelerated):** Bulk sale to liquidators or auction houses
  - Target: Realise 70-85% of NAV (15-30% haircut)
  - Time: 30-60 days to liquidate

**Distribution of Proceeds:** Post-Enforcement Waterfall (see Section 7.4)

-----

#### **C. Noteholder Remedies**

**Individual Noteholder Actions:** Generally prohibited; enforcement actions must be directed by Majority Noteholders through Security Trustee.

**Exception:** Individual Noteholder may sue for payment if:

- Noteholder’s pro rata share of payment is unpaid after acceleration
- Noteholder has not received payment within 60 days of due date
- **ONLY for own pro rata claim** (cannot sue on behalf of class)

**No Setoff:** Noteholders may not setoff claims against Issuer/CarCo.

-----

### **7.4 Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments**

Upon Enforcement Event, collections are applied in the following order:

```
POST-ENFORCEMENT WATERFALL (CarCo):
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1.  Taxes, levies, and assessments (unsubordinated)
2.  Security Trustee fees, expenses, indemnities
3.  Operating Agent / Servicer fees (capped at 60 days)
4.  SENIOR NOTE INTEREST (accrued and unpaid)
5.  SENIOR NOTE PRINCIPAL (Outstanding Amounts)
6.  Senior Note enforcement costs, breakage fees
7.  Mezzanine Note interest (accrued and unpaid)
8.  Mezzanine Note principal (Outstanding Amounts)
9.  Mezzanine Note enforcement costs
10. Junior Note interest (accrued and unpaid)
11. Junior Note principal (Outstanding Amounts)
12. Junior Note enforcement costs
13. Subordinated creditors (if any)
14. Equity (CarCo shareholder - AUTO1 Group SE)

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Key Observations:**

- **Senior notes paid in full** before any mezz notes receive principal
- **No reserve account funding** in post-enforcement (reserves already funded or released)
- **Operating fees capped** at 60 days to limit dilution of creditor recoveries
- **Sequential amortisation** (no pro rata sharing across classes)

**Recovery Analysis (Illustrative Stress Scenario):**

```
ASSUMPTIONS:
  Total Eligible Inventory NAV:        EUR 845.1m
  Liquidation Strategy:                Forced (60 days)
  Liquidation Recovery:                75% of NAV (25% haircut)
  Gross Liquidation Proceeds:          EUR 633.8m

WATERFALL APPLICATION:
  P1-3: Taxes, trustee, servicer fees: (EUR 5.0m)
  P4:   Senior interest (6 months):    (EUR 18.0m)
  P5:   Senior principal:              (EUR 720.0m)
  
  Remaining for Mezz:                  EUR 0 ← WIPEOUT
  
RECOVERIES:
  Senior Notes:    100% (paid in full: EUR 738m)
  Mezzanine Notes:   0% (total loss: EUR 130m)
  Junior Notes:      0% (total loss: EUR 50m)
```

**Sensitivity:**

- **80% recovery:** Seniors recover 100%, Mezz recover 15%, Juniors 0%
- **85% recovery:** Seniors recover 100%, Mezz recover 80%, Juniors 0%
- **90% recovery:** Seniors recover 100%, Mezz recover 100%, Juniors 40%

**Conclusion:** Senior notes benefit from significant credit enhancement; mezz notes are first loss to portfolios experiencing >15% liquidation haircut.

-----

## **8. SERVICER TERMINATION EVENTS**

### **8.1 Servicer Role and Criticality**

**AUTO1 Group SE** acts as **Servicer** and **Operating Agent**, performing:

- Vehicle acquisition (sourcing, bidding, pricing)
- Inventory management (storage, refurbishment, marketing)
- Sales execution (B2B auctions, retail platform management)
- Collections management (payment processing, remittance to Collection Account)
- Reporting (daily BBR, monthly operating reports)

**Criticality:** Servicing operations are **mission-critical**. AUTO1’s proprietary platform, buyer network, and pricing algorithms are non-replicable in short term. Servicer failure would result in immediate liquidity crisis and portfolio value deterioration.

-----

### **8.2 Servicer Termination Events**

The following events permit **termination of Servicer** and appointment of Backup Servicer:

#### **A. Servicer Insolvency**

**Trigger:** AUTO1 Group SE:

- Files for insolvency, bankruptcy, or analogous proceeding
- Admits inability to pay debts
- Has receiver or administrator appointed
- Suspends payments to creditors generally

**Automatic Termination:** Insolvency triggers immediate termination (no notice or cure period required).

**Risk Mitigation:**

- **Backup Servicer** (pre-appointed major German bank or specialised auto servicer) assumes duties within **10 Business Days**
- Backup Servicer has **warm handover rights** (access to systems, data, buyer lists 60 days prior to activation)

-----

#### **A. Failure to Remit Collections**

**Trigger:** Servicer fails to remit collections to Collection Account within **2 Business Days** of receipt

**Cure Period:** **5 Business Days** from due date

**Materiality Threshold:** Applies if:

- Single remittance failure >EUR 1,000,000, OR
- Aggregate remittances in any 30-day period >EUR 5,000,000, OR
- Pattern of late remittances (>3 instances in 6 months)

**Rationale:** 2 BD remittance requirement ensures real-time cash visibility; delays indicate potential commingling or liquidity stress.

-----

#### **C. Material Breach of Servicing Standards**

**Trigger:** Servicer fails to perform servicing obligations in accordance with **Servicing Standard** (level of care exercised by AUTO1 for proprietary inventory)

**Examples:**

- Failure to insure inventory (lapse in coverage)
- Failure to maintain vehicles (allowing deterioration, weathering)
- Failure to pursue collections (writing off debts without pursuing buyers)
- Fraud or gross negligence in vehicle acquisitions (overpaying, kickbacks)

**Cure Period:** **30 days** from notice

**Materiality:** Breach must have (or be reasonably likely to have) **Material Adverse Effect** on portfolio value or noteholder recoveries.

-----

#### **D. Failure to Deliver Reports**

**Trigger:** Servicer fails to deliver required reports:

- Daily Borrowing Base Certificate: 12:00 CET deadline
- Monthly Operating Report: 15th of following month
- Annual Financial Statements: 120 days post year-end

**Cure Period:**

- **Daily BBR:** 2 Business Days (5 BD for initial notice)
- **Monthly reports:** 10 Business Days
- **Annual reports:** 30 days

**Materiality:** Repeated failures (>3 in 12 months) = Servicer Termination Event (no materiality threshold).

-----

#### **E. Change of Control**

**Trigger:** AUTO1 Group SE undergoes **Change of Control** without prior Majority Noteholder consent

**Definition of Change of Control:**

- Acquisition of >50% voting equity by third party, OR
- Change in board composition (>50% of directors replaced within 12 months), OR
- Sale of substantially all assets (>75% of enterprise value)

**Consent Requirement:** Majority Senior Noteholders must approve Change of Control (>66 2/3% vote).

**Rationale:** AUTO1’s servicing capability is tied to management expertise and platform IP; acquirer may lack necessary skills or may prioritise competing business objectives.

-----

#### **F. Financial Covenant Breach (AUTO1 Group)**

**Trigger:** AUTO1 Group SE breaches financial covenants (Section 6.4):

- Minimum liquidity <EUR 100m
- Tangible net worth <EUR 300m
- Interest coverage <2.0x

**Cure Period:** **30 days**

**Servicer Review (Not Automatic Termination):** Financial covenant breach triggers **mandatory Servicer review** by Majority Noteholders:

- Assessment of AUTO1’s ability to continue servicing
- Evaluation of Backup Servicer transition costs and timing
- Decision: (a) waive breach with conditions, (b) terminate Servicer

-----

#### **G. Material Misrepresentation**

**Trigger:** Servicer makes material misrepresentation in servicing reports (e.g., falsifying inventory data, concealing losses)

**No Cure Period:** Fraud or wilful misrepresentation = immediate termination.

**Legal Recourse:** Noteholders may pursue damages against AUTO1 Group SE for fraudulent servicing.

-----

### **8.3 Servicer Termination Process**

#### **Step 1: Notice of Termination**

- **Initiator:** Security Trustee (acting on Majority Noteholder instruction)
- **Delivery:** Written notice to Servicer, Issuer, CarCo, Calculation Agent
- **Effective Date:** Specified in notice (typically 10-30 BD after delivery)

#### **Step 2: Backup Servicer Activation**

- **Pre-Appointed Backup:** [Bank name or specialised servicer] assumes duties immediately upon termination
- **Transition Period:** 10 Business Days for full handover
  - Servicer must provide: IT system access, buyer lists, pending transaction records, inventory locations
  - Backup Servicer completes warm handover procedures (data migration, process training)

**Backup Servicer Duties:**

- Continue vehicle acquisitions (if facility still revolving)
- Execute sales through existing channels (B2B platform, retail)
- Manage collections and remit to Collection Account
- Deliver all required reports to Calculation Agent and noteholders

**Backup Servicer Fees:** Higher than AUTO1 fees (typically +25-50bp premium) to reflect:

- Stand-alone operating costs (no shared services with parent)
- Risk premium for assuming troubled portfolio
- Market rate for third-party servicing

#### **Step 3: Operational Continuity**

**IT Systems:** Backup Servicer must:

- Migrate inventory data to proprietary systems within 30 days
- Maintain operational continuity (no lapse in sales, collections)
- Replicate AUTO1’s buyer network access (or establish alternative channels)

**Performance Deterioration Risk:** Transition to Backup Servicer likely results in:

- **10-20% reduction in sales velocity** (loss of AUTO1’s proprietary buyer network)
- **5-10% margin compression** (Backup Servicer less efficient at pricing)
- **Turn elongation:** 42 days → 55-60 days average hold period

**Mitigation:** Early Amortisation Event (if not already triggered) forces portfolio run-off, reducing reliance on Backup Servicer acquisition/growth activities.

-----

### **8.4 Backup Servicer Failure**

**Scenario:** Backup Servicer is unwilling or unable to assume servicing duties.

**Contingency:**

1. **Security Trustee Direct Management:** Security Trustee appoints receiver to manage portfolio directly

- Receiver has statutory powers under Netherlands law to operate business
- Receiver may engage third-party asset managers (automotive liquidators)

1. **Forced Liquidation:** If no viable servicer available, Security Trustee initiates immediate liquidation

- Portfolio sold in bulk to liquidators (Manheim, BCA, KAR Global)
- Expect **20-30% haircut** to NAV in bulk sale scenario

1. **Early Amortisation / Enforcement:** Servicer failure typically triggers:

- **Early Amortisation Event** (if Backup Servicer unwilling but facility operational)
- **CarCo Enforcement Event** (if Backup Servicer unable and no operational continuity)

**Risk Assessment:** **MEDIUM-LOW** - Backup Servicer is contractually committed; failure would require bilateral insolvency (AUTO1 + Backup Servicer) or market-wide disruption.

-----

### **8.5 Servicing Continuity Risk Mitigation**

**Pre-Closing Requirements:**

- Backup Servicer identified and contractually committed (Backup Servicing Agreement executed)
- Warm handover procedures documented (transition playbook)
- Annual testing of Backup Servicer readiness (mock transition exercises)

**Ongoing Monitoring:**

- Quarterly Servicer performance reviews (KPIs: turn velocity, margin, remittance timeliness)
- Annual financial health assessment of AUTO1 Group SE (credit analysis by Security Trustee)
- Backup Servicer annual certification (confirms continued willingness and ability)

**Noteholder Protections:**

- Majority Noteholder consent required for Servicer replacement (beyond pre-approved Backup)
- Servicer termination fees (payable to AUTO1 if terminated without cause)
- Indemnification from Servicer for breaches causing losses

# **FACILITY STRUCTURE**

-----

## **1. TRANSACTION OVERVIEW**

### **1.1 Structure and Parties**

AUTO1 FT1 B.V., a Netherlands-incorporated bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle referred to as CarCo or the Borrower, operates a revolving warehouse facility secured by a diversified pool of wholesale automotive inventory sourced across multiple European Economic Area jurisdictions. The facility employs a three-tier capital structure issued through a second bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle, AUTO1 Funding 1 B.V., referred to as the Issuer, which issues senior notes, mezzanine notes, and junior notes to institutional investors. The transaction structure ensures complete legal separation between the operating assets held by CarCo and the funding vehicle through which noteholders provide capital, with security interests granted to a Security Trustee acting on behalf of all noteholders in accordance with an intercreditor agreement embedded within the Trust Agreement.

The senior notes represent the most senior class of debt in the capital structure and benefit from first-priority claims on substantially all assets and cash flows generated by CarCo’s inventory operations. These notes are subject to quarterly interest payments based on a floating reference rate plus an applicable margin, with principal repayment occurring either through scheduled amortisation following an early amortisation event or at the legal final maturity date currently scheduled for August 2028. The mezzanine notes rank subordinate to the senior notes but senior to the junior notes, providing an additional layer of credit enhancement to protect senior noteholders from portfolio losses while offering investors a higher yield to compensate for the incremental risk. Junior notes, which are typically retained by AUTO1 Group SE or affiliated entities to satisfy regulatory risk retention requirements under the EU Securitisation Regulation, absorb first losses and provide structural credit enhancement to the senior and mezzanine classes.

The proposed seventh amendment to the transaction documents contemplates a material increase to the senior note commitment from the current level to a substantially higher amount, reflecting AUTO1’s confidence in its ability to scale inventory operations and the lenders’ willingness to provide additional liquidity based on demonstrated portfolio performance over the past several years. This upsize requires corresponding adjustments to reserve account sizing, borrowing base calculations, and various operational metrics to ensure that credit enhancement levels remain consistent with the risk profile of the enlarged facility.

### **1.2 Collateral and Business Model**

CarCo acquires used passenger vehicles from a variety of sources including vehicle auctions operated by major European auction houses, direct purchases from authorised dealerships, fleet disposal programmes, and individual consumers seeking to sell vehicles through AUTO1’s online platform. The vehicles acquired represent primarily mass-market and premium European brands with an emphasis on makes that demonstrate strong liquidity in wholesale secondary markets, ensuring that CarCo can execute sales transactions efficiently and realise trading margins within commercially reasonable timeframes. The inventory pool consists predominantly of vehicles between one and five years of age at the time of acquisition, with purchase prices typically falling within a range designed to target the most liquid segment of the used vehicle market where buyer demand is strongest and price discovery is most transparent.

Upon acquisition, vehicles are inspected using AUTO1’s proprietary evaluation methodology and either sold immediately through wholesale channels to independent dealers, exporters, and other commercial buyers, or briefly reconditioned and offered for sale through [AUTO1.com](http://AUTO1.com), the group’s direct-to-consumer retail platform. The fundamental business model relies on rapid inventory turnover with vehicles held for an average holding period measured in weeks rather than months, minimising exposure to market price volatility and depreciation risk while generating trading margins through efficient sourcing, pricing algorithms that optimise bid strategies at auctions, and access to an extensive pan-European buyer network cultivated over years of operations. This velocity-based approach differentiates the facility from traditional floorplan financing arrangements where dealers may hold inventory for extended periods, as AUTO1’s business model emphasises through-put and margin capture rather than extended retail sales cycles.

The collateral securing the facility consists of the vehicles themselves, which remain legally titled to CarCo throughout the holding period, together with all related rights including proceeds from vehicle sales, insurance proceeds in the event of theft or damage, and any warranty claims or manufacturer buyback rights that may exist. Additional collateral includes CarCo’s bank accounts into which sale proceeds are deposited, intercompany receivables owed to CarCo by other AUTO1 Group entities arising from shared services arrangements, and certain intellectual property licences that permit CarCo to utilise AUTO1’s proprietary software platforms for inventory management, pricing, and buyer matching. The security package is perfected under Netherlands law as the jurisdiction of CarCo’s incorporation and centre of main interests, with additional perfection steps taken in each eligible jurisdiction where vehicles are physically located to ensure that the Security Trustee maintains a first-priority perfected security interest that would be recognised by local courts in enforcement scenarios.

-----

## **2. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT**

### **2.1 Structural Subordination**

The transaction benefits from multiple layers of structural credit enhancement that protect senior noteholders from credit losses arising from vehicle depreciation, operational losses, or broader portfolio deterioration. The primary form of credit enhancement derives from the subordination of mezzanine and junior notes, which absorb losses before senior noteholders experience any diminution in principal or interruption in scheduled interest payments. This subordination operates through the borrowing base mechanism, whereby each class of notes receives advances only up to a specified percentage of the net adjusted value of eligible vehicles, creating natural equity cushions at each level of the capital structure.

The senior notes are entitled to advances representing approximately ninety-one and a half percent of the net adjusted value of eligible collateral, meaning that senior noteholders benefit from an initial overcollateralisation cushion of approximately eight and a half percent before any impairment to their position. This cushion provides protection against various risks including declines in vehicle market values, write-downs on aged or damaged inventory, and haircuts applied when concentration limits are breached and excess amounts must be excluded from the borrowing base calculation. The mezzanine notes receive advances representing approximately ninety-five percent of net adjusted value, providing an additional three and a half percent of cushion beyond the senior notes but substantially less protection than the senior class enjoys. Junior notes notionally represent one hundred percent of net adjusted value, meaning that junior noteholders bear the full risk of the residual five percent of value between the mezzanine advance rate and the gross collateral value.

This advance rate structure ensures that as vehicle values decline or as vehicles are excluded from eligibility due to ageing or other factors, the impact of these events flows first to junior noteholders through mandatory prepayments required to maintain borrowing base coverage, then to mezzanine noteholders if losses exceed the junior cushion, and finally to senior noteholders only after both subordinated classes have been entirely exhausted. The magnitude of loss required to impair senior notes is therefore substantial, requiring either a catastrophic market disruption that causes vehicle values to decline by more than the combined overcollateralisation provided by junior and mezzanine notes, or a fundamental operational failure that prevents CarCo from realising value through orderly liquidation of inventory over a reasonable timeframe.

### **2.2 Reserve Accounts**

Beyond structural subordination, the transaction incorporates three segregated reserve accounts that provide additional liquidity protection for noteholders and ensure that temporary cash flow timing mismatches do not trigger technical defaults or force premature liquidation of portfolio assets. The senior reserve account is sized as the greater of a fixed monetary amount or a percentage of senior notes outstanding, providing a cash buffer that can be drawn upon to cover senior note interest payments in scenarios where collection account balances are temporarily insufficient due to seasonal variations in sales activity or short-term disruptions in market demand. Similarly, the mezzanine reserve account provides comparable protection for mezzanine note interest obligations, though at a lower absolute amount reflecting the smaller size of the mezzanine note class.

The trade tax reserve account serves a different purpose, protecting against potential German trade tax liabilities that might arise from CarCo’s operations given the company’s legal structure and the characterisation of its activities under German tax law. While CarCo has obtained tax opinions supporting the view that its activities should not trigger trade tax obligations, the transaction documents require maintenance of a reserve account as a precautionary measure given the material consequences that would result if tax authorities were to successfully assert trade tax claims against the company. This reserve is maintained at a fixed amount throughout the life of the transaction and is only released upon final maturity once it has been definitively established that no trade tax liability exists.

The reserve accounts rank senior in the priority of payments to virtually all other uses of funds except for certain unsubordinated tax obligations and Security Trustee fees that must be paid to maintain the legal integrity of the structure. Reserve account balances must be replenished on each settlement date if they have fallen below required levels, with replenishment occurring ahead of any distributions to junior noteholders but after payment of senior and mezzanine note interest. This positioning ensures that reserve accounts remain funded even in scenarios where portfolio performance deteriorates, as long as sufficient cash flow exists to service senior and mezzanine interest obligations. The requirement to maintain reserves at specified levels functions as an early warning indicator, as persistent reserve account draws would signal underlying portfolio stress and potentially trigger additional covenant review or lead to the declaration of an early amortisation event if cash generation proves insufficient to support both debt service and reserve maintenance.

### **2.3 Excess Spread and Cash Trapping**

The transaction generates excess spread through the differential between the gross trading margin CarCo realises on vehicle sales and the all-in cost of debt service including interest payments, servicing fees, and operating expenses. This excess spread provides ongoing credit enhancement by creating a renewable source of first-loss absorption that can cover routine credit losses, vehicle write-downs, and other operational shortfalls without requiring draws on structural credit enhancement or reserve accounts. The magnitude of excess spread varies based on market conditions affecting both vehicle acquisition costs and realisation proceeds, but historical performance demonstrates that AUTO1’s business model consistently generates positive net margins that substantially exceed the cost of debt capital.

When portfolio performance deteriorates or when specified trigger events occur, the transaction documents provide for cash trapping mechanisms that redirect excess spread from new inventory purchases and portfolio growth toward mandatory note amortisation, effectively deleveraging the structure and reducing noteholder exposure during periods of stress. This transition from revolving to amortising occurs automatically upon breach of specified performance triggers discussed in detail below, and converts the facility into a term-out structure where all available cash flow after required payments and reserve funding is applied to repay notes sequentially starting with the senior class. The cash trapping mechanism provides powerful protection for senior noteholders by ensuring that deteriorating portfolio conditions do not lead to increased borrowings and greater leverage, but instead trigger automatic deleveraging that reduces exposure while maintaining the prioritisation of senior claims over all subordinated classes.

## **3. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**

### **3.1 Vehicle-Level Requirements**

For a vehicle to qualify as eligible collateral that contributes to the borrowing base calculation, it must satisfy numerous criteria designed to ensure that the portfolio consists of readily marketable assets with transparent valuations and liquid secondary markets. These eligibility criteria function as fundamental risk controls by excluding vehicles that present heightened operational complexity, legal risk, valuation uncertainty, or limited buyer demand, thereby maintaining portfolio quality at a level consistent with the advance rates applied in borrowing base calculations and the assumptions underlying rating agency credit models.

Purchase price constraints establish both minimum and maximum thresholds that target the most liquid segment of the used vehicle market where transaction volumes are highest and price discovery is most transparent. Vehicles priced below the minimum threshold are excluded as they typically represent distressed assets, salvage vehicles, or units with severe mechanical issues that require substantial refurbishment investment before they can be marketed to end buyers, creating execution risk and valuation uncertainty. Vehicles priced above the maximum threshold are excluded because luxury and specialty vehicles trade in thinner markets with fewer potential buyers, longer typical holding periods, and greater sensitivity to economic cycles that can dramatically impact buyer willingness to acquire high-value discretionary assets. The establishment of upper and lower bounds ensures that substantially all eligible inventory falls within the mass-market and premium segments where AUTO1 has demonstrated consistent success in executing sales transactions and realising predictable trading margins.

Age and vintage restrictions prevent the inclusion of older vehicles that face accelerated depreciation, increasing mechanical failure risk, and diminishing buyer demand as potential purchasers become concerned about remaining useful life and potential repair costs. The eligibility criteria specify a maximum age measured from initial registration rather than model year, ensuring that the calculation captures actual time in service rather than potentially misleading model year designations that could include vehicles manufactured near year-end and sold in the following calendar year. Vehicles exceeding the maximum age threshold are excluded even if they remain in good mechanical condition, as market data demonstrates that older vehicles experience greater volatility in realisable values and require longer marketing periods to identify willing buyers at acceptable prices.

Mileage limitations serve a similar function by excluding high-mileage vehicles that present elevated mechanical risk and reduced buyer appeal regardless of chronological age. Commercial fleet vehicles, which may accumulate high mileage over relatively short time periods, are excluded if odometer readings exceed specified thresholds, even if the vehicles are chronologically young and remain in good cosmetic condition. The combination of age and mileage restrictions ensures that the eligible portfolio consists of vehicles in the sweet spot of the used car value curve where depreciation rates are moderate, mechanical reliability remains high, and buyer demand is strong across both wholesale and retail channels.

### **3.2 Title and Legal Status**

Eligibility requires that each vehicle have clean title with no salvage, rebuilt, flood damage, or other adverse designations that would materially impair marketability or create legal complications in resale transactions. Vehicles with branded titles are categorically excluded from the borrowing base regardless of their current mechanical condition or cosmetic appearance, as title brands carry significant negative stigma in secondary markets and can trigger disclosure requirements that complicate sales transactions or provide buyers with grounds to reject vehicles or negotiate substantial price reductions. CarCo must maintain documentary evidence of clean title for each eligible vehicle including title certificates or equivalent documentation issued by the relevant national vehicle registration authority in each eligible jurisdiction.

The absence of third-party liens constitutes a fundamental eligibility requirement, as vehicles subject to prior security interests cannot provide first-priority collateral to the Security Trustee and would create enforcement complications in default scenarios. Before designating any vehicle as eligible, CarCo must conduct appropriate lien searches through national registries to verify that no prior security interests, tax liens, or other encumbrances exist that would impair the Security Trustee’s ability to perfect a first-priority security interest or realise full value in enforcement. Vehicles discovered to have undisclosed liens are immediately reclassified as ineligible and excluded from the borrowing base until the liens are satisfied and formal releases obtained from the lienholders confirming that their security interests have been terminated.

Outstanding manufacturer recalls present a nuanced eligibility consideration, as vehicles subject to open recall notices may remain marketable if sold with appropriate disclosures but may face buyer resistance or reduced valuations depending on the nature and severity of the underlying safety issue. The transaction documents establish specific protocols for handling recalled vehicles, generally permitting their inclusion in the borrowing base if AUTO1 provides appropriate disclosures to potential buyers and obtains acknowledgments that buyers accept responsibility for addressing recall issues post-sale, but excluding vehicles from eligibility if recall notices indicate severe safety defects that would make operation of the vehicle unlawful or would expose AUTO1 to potential liability for continued marketing of defective products.

### **3.3 Geographic and Operational Requirements**

Eligibility is restricted to vehicles physically located in specified European jurisdictions where AUTO1 maintains operational presence, has established buyer networks, and where the Security Trustee can confidently perfect security interests in compliance with local law requirements. The list of eligible jurisdictions includes the core Western European markets where AUTO1 conducts the substantial majority of its business, together with select Central and Eastern European markets where the company has developed sufficient scale to justify the legal and operational complexity of including these jurisdictions in the collateral pool. The geographic restrictions reflect both commercial considerations regarding AUTO1’s ability to source vehicles and execute sales in particular markets, and legal considerations regarding the enforceability of security interests and the practical ability to recover and liquidate collateral in enforcement scenarios.

Vehicles located outside eligible jurisdictions are categorically excluded from the borrowing base even if they otherwise satisfy all vehicle-level eligibility criteria, creating a clear bright-line rule that prevents gradual expansion of geographic scope without explicit approval from noteholders through formal amendment processes. This restriction serves multiple purposes including limiting the Security Trustee’s enforcement complexity to a manageable set of legal regimes, ensuring that portfolio composition remains consistent with rating agency assumptions and investor expectations, and preventing CarCo from deploying borrowed funds to experiment with new markets where business model feasibility has not been demonstrated and where exit options may be limited if market entry proves unsuccessful.

Certain jurisdictions initially included in the eligible jurisdiction list may be subsequently excluded through formal amendments if legal, regulatory, or operational developments make continued operations in those markets impractical or create unacceptable risks for noteholders. The transaction documents provide mechanisms for such exclusions including time-limited transition periods during which vehicles in newly-excluded jurisdictions remain eligible provided they are sold or relocated to eligible jurisdictions within specified timeframes, preventing sudden value haircuts that would result from immediate blanket ineligibility declarations.

### **3.4 Time-Based and Performance-Based Exclusions**

Beyond static eligibility criteria based on vehicle characteristics at acquisition, the transaction documents impose time-based exclusions that remove vehicles from eligibility if they remain unsold beyond specified holding period thresholds. This time-based cliff reflects the market reality that vehicles held in inventory for extended periods face accelerated depreciation, likely suffer from mechanical issues or lack buyer appeal that prevented earlier sale, and represent higher-than-average credit risk that should not support the same advance rates as fresh inventory with normal turnover characteristics. The establishment of maximum holding periods creates incentives for efficient inventory management and ensures that borrowing base calculations do not assign full value to aged inventory that may require significant price concessions to clear.

Concentration-based exclusions automatically apply when aggregate exposure to particular vehicle characteristics exceeds specified limits, with the excess amounts excluded from net adjusted value calculations regardless of whether the individual vehicles comprising the excess meet all other eligibility criteria. This mechanism prevents scenarios where CarCo might satisfy all individual-vehicle requirements while constructing a portfolio with dangerous concentrations in particular makes, geographies, or vintage bands that would present unacceptable single-point-of-failure risk if market conditions deteriorated in the concentrated segment. The automatic exclusion of excess amounts above concentration limits creates real-time deleveraging without requiring affirmative action by parties to the transaction, as borrowing base calculations mechanically reduce available borrowing capacity when concentrations exceed limits until CarCo diversifies the portfolio composition or liquidates excess inventory in the over-concentrated segments.

-----

## **4. CONCENTRATION LIMITS**

### **4.1 Single-Name and Manufacturer Concentration**

The transaction documents establish concentration limits that prevent over-reliance on any single vehicle manufacturer or brand, recognising that manufacturer-specific events including product quality issues, regulatory challenges, or reputational damage can simultaneously impact values across an entire make regardless of model or vintage. The single-make concentration limit is expressed as a maximum percentage of eligible inventory value attributable to vehicles bearing any single manufacturer’s nameplate, calculated on each borrowing base test date based on the net adjusted value of vehicles from that manufacturer divided by total eligible inventory net adjusted value.

When concentration in a particular make exceeds the specified limit, the transaction documents require exclusion of an excess amount equal to the difference between actual concentration and the maximum permitted concentration, with the excluded amount calculated based on net adjusted value rather than vehicle count to ensure that the financial impact of concentration breaches flows through to borrowing base calculations in proportion to the actual risk exposure. The methodology for selecting which specific vehicles to exclude when a make exceeds concentration limits is generally left to CarCo’s discretion subject to operating guidelines, though the transaction documents typically establish default exclusion hierarchies that remove the oldest, highest-mileage, or lowest-margin vehicles first to minimise the portfolio quality impact of concentration-driven exclusions.

The concentration limit framework recognises that certain makes may justify higher concentration tolerance than others based on market liquidity characteristics, with the single-make limit potentially set at different levels for premium brands with deep secondary markets versus volume brands where buyer demand may be more concentrated among particular buyer segments. The transaction documents generally establish uniform limits across all makes to avoid complexity and prevent disputes about appropriate differentiation between brands, but the limit level is calibrated based on analysis of the broader portfolio composition to ensure that normal business operations do not continuously breach concentration limits absent deliberate portfolio skew toward particular manufacturers.

### **4.2 Geographic Concentration**

Geographic concentration limits prevent over-reliance on any single national market, recognising that country-specific economic downturns, regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer preferences can simultaneously impact vehicle values and buyer demand across an entire jurisdiction regardless of manufacturer or vehicle characteristics. The transaction documents typically establish both a primary limit on concentration in the largest market, which for AUTO1 is inevitably Germany given the company’s origins and operational focus, and potentially secondary limits on exposure to smaller markets where LOCAL conditions might deteriorate without providing diversification benefits to offset the concentration risk.

The rationale for permitting higher concentration in the primary market reflects the reality that this market represents AUTO1’s core competency where the company maintains the deepest buyer relationships, most sophisticated pricing capabilities, and greatest operational scale to efficiently turn inventory. Attempting to artificially limit concentration below the natural business mix would force economically irrational diversification that might actually increase risk by pushing CarCo to acquire inventory in markets where execution capabilities are weaker and where liquidation options might be more limited in stress scenarios. The calibration of geographic concentration limits therefore represents a balance between diversification benefits and operational efficiency considerations, with the limits set at levels that permit normal operations while preventing extreme concentrations that would create unacceptable single-market dependency.

### **4.3 Vintage and Age-Based Concentration**

While the eligibility criteria establish maximum age thresholds that create hard cutoffs for individual vehicle inclusion, concentration limits often impose additional constraints on aggregate exposure to particular vintage bands recognising that vehicles of similar age tend to exhibit correlated performance during market stress. Concentration limits on current-year vehicles prevent excessive exposure to new-car depreciation curves which demonstrate steep value declines in the first twelve to eighteen months of a vehicle’s life, making high concentrations of current-year inventory particularly vulnerable to rapid value deterioration if market conditions shift or if manufacturers increase incentives on new vehicles that compress used vehicle valuations for near-new inventory. Concentration limits on older vehicles prevent creep toward a portfolio composition dominated by aged inventory that would be inconsistent with AUTO1’s business model emphasis on rapid turnover of relatively young vehicles.

The interaction between hard eligibility cutoffs and soft concentration limits creates a multi-layered approach to vintage risk management, with individual vehicles excluded upon reaching maximum age while the concentration limits ensure that aggregate exposure to vehicles approaching the age threshold remains moderate even if those vehicles technically remain eligible. This framework prevents scenarios where CarCo might concentrate the portfolio at the edge of eligibility criteria by acquiring large volumes of vehicles just under the age cutoff, which might technically satisfy eligibility rules while creating a portfolio composition inconsistent with the risk profile contemplated in advance rate calibration.

### **4.4 Aged Inventory Concentration**

Distinct from vintage-based limits which focus on chronological age from initial registration, aged inventory limits focus on holding period by establishing maximum thresholds for the percentage of vehicles held beyond specified duration measured from acquisition date. These limits recognise that holding period represents a more direct indicator of liquidity risk than chronological age, as vehicles that CarCo has been unable to sell within normal turnover timeframes likely suffer from specific defects, market mismatches, or pricing issues that make them demonstrably less liquid than similar vehicles that sold quickly.

The aged inventory concentration limit operates as both a risk management tool and a performance discipline mechanism, forcing CarCo to take action on slow-moving inventory through price concessions, transfers to alternative sales channels, or ultimate liquidation rather than permitting aged inventory to accumulate indefinitely while CarCo continuously rolls forward hopes that market conditions will improve or that the right buyer will eventually emerge. When aged inventory concentration exceeds limits, the transaction documents require that the oldest inventory be excluded from borrowing base calculations first, creating direct financial pressure through reduced borrowing capacity that incentivises prompt resolution of aged inventory situations.

The calibration of appropriate holding period thresholds for aged inventory designation reflects analysis of AUTO1’s historical turnover distributions, with the threshold typically set at a level that captures inventory in the tail of the distribution where holding periods substantially exceed modal values and where historical data demonstrates that vehicles held for these extended periods realise materially lower margins than inventory that turns within normal timeframes. The concentration limit itself is set at a level that permits some aged inventory to reflect normal statistical variation and seasonal patterns while preventing aged inventory from becoming a material portion of the overall portfolio that would be inconsistent with the fundamental velocity-based business model.

### **4.5 Mechanics of Concentration Breach and Remediation**

When concentration limits are breached, the transaction documents generally provide for automatic exclusion of excess amounts from net adjusted value rather than immediate requirement to sell inventory or prepay notes, recognising that temporary concentration spikes may occur naturally through timing of acquisition and sales activities and that forced immediate liquidation would be economically inefficient. The exclusion of excess amounts from borrowing base calculations creates natural pressure for remediation by reducing available borrowing capacity, which may in turn trigger borrowing base shortfall requirements for mandatory prepayment if notes outstanding exceed the reduced borrowing base value incorporating concentration haircuts.

CarCo has several options for remediating concentration breaches including liquidation of inventory in the over-concentrated segment, which directly reduces concentration by eliminating the source of excess exposure; acquisition of additional inventory in under-concentrated segments, which dilutes existing concentrations by increasing the denominator in concentration calculations; or acceptance of reduced borrowing capacity, which may be feasible if notes outstanding remain comfortably below the concentration-adjusted borrowing base value and if CarCo has sufficient alternative funding sources to support working capital needs without maximising note issuance. The choice among remediation options depends on market conditions, funding needs, and tactical considerations regarding optimal portfolio composition given current market dynamics and buyer demand patterns.

Persistent or repeated concentration breaches would trigger enhanced reporting requirements and potentially lead to declarations of early amortisation events if breaches appear to reflect systematic drift in portfolio composition rather than temporary operational variations. The transaction documents generally provide cure periods measured in business days during which CarCo must either remediate the breach through one of the mechanisms described above or demonstrate that the breach results from temporary factors that will naturally resolve through normal course operations without requiring affirmative remediation actions.

-----

## **5. PERFORMANCE TRIGGERS**

### **5.1 Early Amortisation Events - Overview and Rationale**

Early amortisation events represent the primary mechanism through which the transaction protects noteholders from deteriorating portfolio performance by converting the facility from a revolving structure where CarCo can continuously redraw available capacity to finance new inventory purchases, to an amortising structure where all excess cash flow is mandatorily applied to repay notes in sequential order of seniority. This conversion dramatically alters the economics and risk profile of the facility by eliminating CarCo’s ability to grow or even maintain the portfolio size during periods of stress, instead forcing progressive deleveraging that reduces noteholder exposure and concentrates remaining available collateral behind a shrinking note balance. The declaration of an early amortisation event does not constitute an event of default and does not trigger acceleration or enforcement rights, but rather represents an intermediate intervention designed to protect noteholders while permitting CarCo to continue operations under more restrictive constraints.

The performance triggers that precipitate early amortisation are calibrated to activate when portfolio metrics deteriorate beyond normal operational variations but before losses materialise that would threaten noteholder recoveries, providing an early warning system that initiates protective measures while significant credit enhancement remains in place. The selection of appropriate trigger levels and metrics reflects analysis of historical portfolio performance to identify leading indicators that reliably predict potential future stress while avoiding false positive triggers that would unnecessarily disrupt operations during temporary market fluctuations. The multi-metric approach employing several different triggers recognises that portfolio stress can manifest through various channels including liquidity pressure, collateral value deterioration, or operational performance degradation, with different triggers designed to detect each potential stress vector.

### **5.2 Cash Trading Margin Trigger**

The cash trading margin test functions as a liquidity-focused early amortisation trigger by measuring the relationship between available liquidity sources and total inventory value, ensuring that CarCo maintains sufficient cash and undrawn commitments relative to portfolio size to meet operational needs and provide cushion for temporary cash flow variations. The calculation of available liquidity incorporates cash balances in collection accounts and committed but undrawn note capacity, representing the total resources CarCo could immediately deploy for working capital needs or debt service obligations without requiring additional portfolio liquidation. Required adjustments subtract minimum operational balances necessary for ordinary course business operations and any pending settlement obligations for vehicle purchases not yet funded, yielding a net available liquidity figure that represents genuine financial flexibility.

The ratio of available liquidity to total eligible inventory value provides an indicator of financial stress that degrades as portfolio size grows without corresponding increases in committed funding capacity or as cash balances decline due to operational losses or timing mismatches between collections and disbursements. A declining cash trading margin signals potential liquidity pressure that could force CarCo into premature inventory liquidation to generate working capital, potentially realising suboptimal pricing and crystallising losses that might otherwise be avoided through patient inventory management. The trigger threshold is set at a level calibrated to provide comfortable headroom for normal operations while detecting situations where continued portfolio growth or maintenance at current levels would strain liquidity resources.

In practice, the cash trading margin trigger is unlikely to activate during normal market conditions given the magnitude of committed but undrawn note capacity relative to typical portfolio size, meaning that CarCo would need to either draw notes to very high utilisation levels or experience significant cash drain before approaching trigger thresholds. The trigger serves primarily as a backstop protection against scenarios where CarCo might attempt to maximise leverage by drawing notes to capacity while operating with minimal cash reserves, or where operational losses might deplete cash balances without corresponding reduction in inventory value, creating a mismatch between assets and available liquidity to support those assets.

### **5.3 Borrowing Base Coverage Tests**

The borrowing base coverage tests represent the most direct measure of structural overcollateralisation by comparing the borrowing base value calculated by applying advance rates to net adjusted value of eligible inventory against the actual outstanding balance of notes at each class level. When borrowing base value falls below outstanding notes for any class, a borrowing base shortfall exists that indicates degradation of credit enhancement to levels below those contemplated in the transaction structure, requiring either mandatory prepayment to restore coverage or addition of eligible inventory to increase borrowing base value. The frequency of borrowing base testing on every settlement date ensures that coverage shortfalls are detected and remediated promptly before they deteriorate to levels that would threaten more senior classes or require dramatic portfolio liquidation to cure.

Senior note borrowing base coverage is calculated by multiplying eligible inventory net adjusted value by the senior advance rate and comparing the result to senior notes outstanding, with full coverage existing when borrowing base value meets or exceeds outstanding notes and a shortfall existing when outstanding notes exceed borrowing base value. This test directly measures the senior overcollateralisation cushion, with values above one hundred percent indicating that senior notes benefit from excess collateral coverage beyond the minimum required advance rate, while values approaching one hundred percent indicate erosion of the overcollateralisation cushion to minimal levels. Breach of the senior borrowing base coverage test would represent severe portfolio deterioration given the size of junior and mezzanine classes that should absorb losses before senior coverage deteriorates, making senior borrowing base shortfall an extreme stress indicator that would likely trigger not just early amortisation but potentially lead to declarations of events of default if not promptly remediated.

Mezzanine note borrowing base coverage is tested against the combined mezzanine advance rate applied to eligible inventory, with the mezzanine borrowing base value representing the total amount that should be available to support both senior and mezzanine notes. Testing total borrowing base value against combined senior and mezzanine notes outstanding ensures that sufficient collateral exists to support both classes of secured debt while leaving the junior class to absorb first losses. Mezzanine borrowing base shortfalls indicate deterioration of overcollateralisation to levels where the junior class has been substantially or entirely consumed, placing mezzanine noteholders in a first-loss position and signalling material portfolio stress that threatens to impair recovery prospects for both senior and mezzanine classes if not arrested through mandatory amortisation.

### **5.4 Reserve Account Deficiency Trigger**

Reserve account deficiency triggers activate when the sum of amounts on deposit in designated reserve accounts falls below the required minimum levels on any settlement date after application of the relevant priority of payments. This trigger serves as an indicator of cash generation stress, as reserve accounts are positioned relatively high in the payment priority and should be funded ahead of junior distributions and portfolio growth financing, meaning that persistent reserve deficiencies indicate that cash flow generation has deteriorated to levels barely sufficient to cover senior obligations with insufficient excess to maintain liquidity reserves. The provision of grace periods measured in business days recognises that temporary reserve account draws may result from timing mismatches or seasonal fluctuations rather than fundamental portfolio distress, providing time for reserves to be replenished through normal collections before triggering early amortisation.

The requirement to maintain reserve accounts at specified levels serves multiple purposes including provision of readily accessible liquidity for interest payments that might otherwise experience timing delays, demonstration of ongoing cash generation capacity sufficient to service debt and maintain prudent liquidity buffers, and creation of an early warning indicator when cash generation deteriorates to levels that threaten sustainability of debt service. Reserve account deficiencies often manifest earlier than borrowing base coverage deterioration because reserve funding occurs from cash flow rather than collateral value, meaning that operational performance problems appear through reserve draws before they necessarily translate into net adjusted value reductions that would trigger borrowing base shortfalls.

### **5.5 Covenant Breach Triggers**

Certain covenant breaches specified in the transaction documents precipitate early amortisation events when not cured within prescribed timeframes, recognising that some covenant violations signal fundamental problems with portfolio management or operational execution that warrant defensive measures even if financial metrics appear adequate. The types of covenant breaches that trigger early amortisation typically focus on operational covenants related to portfolio quality and eligibility compliance rather than administrative reporting failures that might be cured without indicating substantive problems. Aged inventory concentration breaches represent a particularly important category of covenant breach triggers, as persistent excess aged inventory directly contradicts the fundamental business model premise of rapid inventory turnover and indicates either deteriorating market conditions that prevent efficient liquidation or operational dysfunction in pricing and marketing activities.

The interaction between covenant breach triggers and cure periods creates a structured escalation pathway where initial covenant violations receive notice and opportunity for remediation without immediate facility-wide consequences, while persistent or repeated violations eventually trigger early amortisation as protective response to demonstrated inability to maintain portfolio quality within agreed parameters. The calibration of cure periods reflects judgment about reasonable timeframes for remediation of different types of covenant breaches, with operational covenants generally receiving longer cure periods than financial covenants recognising that portfolio rebalancing and operational improvements require longer execution timeframes than financial actions like capital raises or asset sales.

### **5.6 Servicer Events Leading to Early Amortisation**

Certain servicer-related events trigger early amortisation when they result in servicer termination without immediate assumption of servicing duties by the backup servicer, recognising that continuity of servicing operations is critical to portfolio value preservation and that gaps in servicing coverage create risks of collection failures, inventory deterioration, and operational chaos that threaten noteholder interests even if underlying collateral remains sound. The trigger activates when the servicer is terminated or resigns without the backup servicer immediately stepping into the role, or when the backup servicer assumes duties but demonstrates material deficiencies in servicing quality that suggest ongoing operational problems despite formal transfer of servicing responsibilities.

The decision to trigger early amortisation rather than immediate enforcement upon servicing disruptions reflects the judgment that portfolio liquidation under security trustee supervision may proceed more successfully in an early amortisation framework where some operational continuity exists than in a full enforcement scenario that requires immediate cessation of normal business activities and wholesale liquidation. Early amortisation following servicer events permits an orderly wind-down where vehicles continue to be marketed through normal channels under backup servicer management with collections applied to sequential note amortisation, avoiding fire-sale liquidation dynamics that could crystallise substantial losses even if underlying portfolio quality remains reasonable.

## **6. COVENANTS**

### **6.1 Affirmative Covenants - Reporting and Information**

CarCo and the servicer undertake extensive affirmative covenants requiring delivery of regular reports and financial information to permit ongoing monitoring of portfolio performance and compliance with transaction terms. The reporting framework includes daily delivery of borrowing base certificates providing detailed vehicle-level data that enables calculation agent verification of eligibility status, concentration compliance, and borrowing base value calculations, ensuring that any deterioration in portfolio metrics is immediately visible to transaction parties who can then assess whether protective actions are warranted. The granularity of daily reporting reflects the high-velocity nature of AUTO1’s business model where significant portfolio turnover occurs within each reporting period, making periodic reporting on less frequent intervals insufficient to maintain current visibility into actual collateral composition and value.

Beyond daily operational reporting, the covenant structure requires periodic delivery of financial statements for both CarCo and the servicer, enabling assessment of financial health at both the special purpose vehicle level and the parent company level that provides servicing capabilities. Annual financial statements must be prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and audited by independent accountants meeting specified qualification criteria, providing assurance regarding accuracy and completeness of financial information and creating professional accountability for statement preparers and auditors who could face liability for material misstatements. The requirement for audited financials rather than unaudited management representations reflects the materiality of the financing and the limited operating history of CarCo as a special purpose vehicle, making independent verification of financial information critical to noteholder ability to assess ongoing credit risk.

The covenant package requires prompt notice of material events including covenant breaches, early amortisation events, events of default, litigation or regulatory proceedings above specified monetary thresholds, and any events having or reasonably likely to have material adverse effects on CarCo’s business or financial condition. This notice obligation creates affirmative duties to disclose problems even when they might not yet have triggered covenant violations or performance triggers, ensuring that noteholders receive timely information about emerging issues rather than learning of problems only when they crystallise into formal breaches. The obligation to deliver bad news promptly sometimes creates tension with natural human and organisational reluctance to publicise problems, making the contractual specificity of notice obligations important to overcome institutional tendencies toward delay in disclosure of adverse information.

### **6.2 Affirmative Covenants - Maintenance and Operations**

CarCo covenants to maintain the collateral in good condition and repair, maintain insurance coverage meeting specified requirements with loss payee designations favouring the security trustee, and generally preserve the value of pledged assets through reasonable operational practices. The maintenance covenant recognises that inventory is perishable in the sense that vehicles deteriorate if stored improperly, with exposure to weather causing rust and cosmetic damage, lack of regular operation causing mechanical seals to dry and fluids to degrade, and inadequate security leading to theft or vandalism. The covenant requires that vehicles be stored in facilities meeting minimum standards for weather protection and security, with regular inspection protocols to identify and address any developing mechanical or cosmetic issues before they materially impact salability or market value.

Insurance requirements extend beyond basic physical damage coverage to include liability coverage protecting against claims arising from vehicle operation, ownership, and sale, together with errors and omissions coverage for the servicer protecting against claims arising from defects in documentation, failure to disclose vehicle history information, or other professional service failures in acquisition and disposition activities. The specification of minimum coverage amounts and requirements regarding insurance company ratings ensure that insurance protection is genuine rather than illusory through placement with marginal carriers who might lack financial capacity to pay claims in stress scenarios when losses are highest. Loss payee designations ensure that insurance proceeds flow to the security trustee rather than CarCo in event of losses, preventing diversion of insurance recoveries to alternative uses that might leave noteholders bearing the economic impact of collateral losses.

The covenant structure requires maintenance of all required governmental licenses and regulatory approvals necessary to conduct automotive trading operations in eligible jurisdictions, including dealer licenses, auction access credentials, and any other permissions required to lawfully purchase and sell vehicles. The loss of critical licenses or regulatory approvals could severely impair CarCo’s ability to execute its business model, making maintenance of licenses a fundamental covenant that protects the operational viability of the enterprise. The requirement for prompt notice of license revocations or regulatory enforcement actions provides early warning of potential operational disruptions, enabling noteholders to assess whether protective measures are needed before problems escalate to levels that threaten portfolio liquidation capabilities.

### **6.3 Negative Covenants - Limitations on Actions**

The negative covenant package imposes extensive restrictions on CarCo’s ability to engage in activities or transactions outside the narrow business purpose defined in transaction documents, recognising that special purpose vehicle structures depend on limiting entity activities to those specifically contemplated in structuring documentation to preserve bankruptcy remoteness and ensure that entity assets remain available to satisfy secured obligations. The prohibition on incurring indebtedness outside permitted categories prevents CarCo from leveraging the collateral to raise additional funds that might compete with noteholders’ security interests or create complications in enforcement scenarios where multiple creditor constituencies exist with potentially conflicting interests. Permitted indebtedness typically includes only the notes issued under transaction documents, ordinary course trade payables arising from vehicle purchases that settle within specified short timeframes, and potentially permitted hedging obligations entered into to manage interest rate risks on floating rate note obligations.

Restrictions on liens and encumbrances prevent CarCo from granting security interests in pledged collateral to any party other than the security trustee, ensuring that noteholders maintain first-priority perfected security interests that would be respected in bankruptcy or enforcement proceedings. The prohibition includes both voluntary liens that CarCo might deliberately grant to raise additional financing, and certain types of involuntary liens that might arise through operation of law including tax liens, mechanics’ liens, or judgment liens resulting from litigation losses. Permitted lien exceptions are narrowly drawn to include only liens that either rank junior to noteholder security interests by operation of applicable law, or liens arising from specific types of obligations where lien rights are commercially necessary to conduct business operations and where monetary exposure is capped at immaterial levels.

The fundamental change provisions prohibit mergers, consolidations, liquidations, or changes in corporate structure without noteholder consent, preventing CarCo from fundamentally altering its legal form or combining with other entities in ways that might impair security interests or dilute noteholder protections. Equally important are prohibitions on changes in jurisdiction of incorporation or centre of main interests, which could trigger complex cross-border insolvency considerations and potentially subject the entity to less favourable legal regimes with greater creditor uncertainty. The restriction on fundamental changes reflects the reality that noteholders underwrote credit risk based on specific structural features and legal considerations applicable to Netherlands-incorporated special purpose vehicles operating under Netherlands law, with changes to those fundamental parameters potentially altering risk profile in ways that noteholders might reasonably reject as inconsistent with original underwriting.

### **6.4 Servicer Covenants**

The servicer undertakes covenants governing operational performance standards, collection procedures, and remittance timing designed to ensure that servicing activities are conducted in manner that preserves collateral value and maximises recoveries for noteholders. The servicing standard requires that the servicer manage, administer, and service the portfolio with the same level of care and diligence that the servicer applies to comparable automotive inventory held for its own account, creating a meaningful benchmark that prevents servicer from treating pledged collateral as lower priority than its proprietary assets. This relative standard provides flexibility recognising that perfect operational execution is unrealistic while creating clear expectations that CarCo’s inventory receives comparable attention and resources to servicer’s own inventory that directly impacts servicer’s financial performance.

Collection covenants impose strict requirements on timing and procedures for depositing vehicle sale proceeds into collection accounts pledged to the security trustee, preventing commingling of CarCo collections with servicer or parent company funds that could create misappropriation risk or complicate tracing of funds in insolvency scenarios. The requirement for collection remittance within specified short timeframes measured in business days ensures that sale proceeds are segregated promptly after receipt rather than remaining in servicer’s operating accounts where they might be consumed for servicer’s own purposes or become subject to servicer’s creditors’ claims if servicer encountered financial distress. The combination of anti-commingling provisions and fast remittance requirements creates multiple layers of protection against collection leakage that might otherwise represent significant risk given that servicer handles all operational aspects of vehicle sales and payment receipt.

Record-keeping covenants require maintenance of complete and accurate documentation regarding each vehicle’s acquisition, holding period, disposition, and proceeds, providing audit trails that enable verification of servicer’s compliance with operational requirements and creation of evidentiary support that might be needed in dispute resolution or litigation contexts. The records must be maintained in formats and locations that permit security trustee and noteholder access upon reasonable notice, preventing servicer from asserting proprietary claims to records or from using physical control of documentation to impede oversight activities. The durability and accessibility of records becomes particularly critical in servicer termination scenarios where successor servicers need rapid access to historical information to maintain operational continuity and avoid disruptions that could impair collection efforts or sales execution.

### **6.5 Financial Covenants**

While CarCo itself typically has no financial maintenance covenants given its structure as a special purpose vehicle with limited activities and no meaningful financial statement complexity, the servicer or parent company guaranteeing servicing performance may be subject to financial covenants designed to provide early warning of potential servicer financial distress that could impair servicing quality or lead to servicer termination. Financial covenants applicable to servicer entities focus on liquidity measures ensuring sufficient cash resources to support ongoing operations, leverage ratios preventing excessive debt accumulation that might threaten financial stability, and profitability or cash flow metrics demonstrating sustainable business performance capable of supporting long-term servicing obligations.

The calibration of servicer financial covenants reflects tension between desire for robust financial requirements that provide meaningful protection against servicer failure, and recognition that overly restrictive covenants might be breached during normal business cycle fluctuations or strategic investments that temporarily depress profitability without indicating fundamental business deterioration. The inclusion of reasonable cure periods and measurement conventions using trailing averages or adjustments for non-recurring items reflects effort to design financial covenants that detect genuine financial distress while avoiding false positive triggers from temporary factors or accounting treatments that might technically breach numerical thresholds without indicating real problems.

Breach of servicer financial covenants typically does not trigger automatic servicer termination but rather initiates review periods during which servicer must demonstrate remediation plans and potentially accept enhanced oversight or restrictions on activities pending restoration of covenant compliance. This graduated response recognises that immediate servicer replacement upon financial covenant breach might be operationally disruptive and potentially premature if servicer can cure breaches through readily available actions like capital raises or operational improvements, while still providing noteholders with important information about servicer financial condition and creating framework for escalation to servicer termination if financial problems prove persistent or deteriorate further despite remediation efforts.

## **7. EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

### **7.1 Payment Defaults**

Non-payment of principal, interest, or fees when due constitutes the most fundamental category of event of default, reflecting the basic premise that borrowers must honour financial obligations according to agreed terms and that failure to make contractually required payments indicates either inability to perform or unwillingness to perform that justifies acceleration and enforcement. The transaction documents typically provide grace periods for payment defaults measured in business days from scheduled payment dates, recognising that administrative errors, payment system failures, or temporary timing mismatches might cause brief payment delays that do not reflect genuine inability or unwillingness to pay and that should not trigger the dramatic consequences of event of default declarations including acceleration, cross-defaults, and reputational damage associated with formal default status.

The length of grace periods varies depending on payment type and severity of non-payment, with principal payments generally receiving longer grace periods than interest payments reflecting the greater materiality of principal defaults, while certain payments including amounts due on final maturity dates may receive minimal or no grace periods reflecting judgment that parties have had ample time to prepare for scheduled maturity and that failure to pay on maturity indicates terminal failure requiring immediate protective response. Interest payment defaults typically receive intermediate grace periods balancing the recurring nature of interest obligations and potential for temporary cash flow mismatches against the importance of interest payments to noteholder yield and the concern that delayed interest payments may signal deteriorating cash generation capacity.

The interaction between payment default provisions and junior cure rights creates complexity regarding whether junior capital injections that cure senior payment shortfalls within grace periods prevent events of default from occurring, or whether the underlying inability to make scheduled payments from operating cash flow constitutes default despite subsequent cure. The transaction documents address this ambiguity by providing that cures completed within grace periods prevent events of default from arising, while preserving noteholder rights to declare events of default based on underlying inability to pay from operating sources if they conclude that cure capital represents unsustainable life support rather than temporary bridge financing pending resolution of short-term operational disruptions.

### **7.2 Covenant Defaults**

Breach of affirmative or negative covenants constitutes events of default when breaches are not cured within applicable cure periods or when breaches are of types deemed so fundamental that no cure opportunity is appropriate. The differentiation between curable and non-curable covenant breaches reflects judgments about whether particular violations can be remedied through subsequent corrective action or whether violations cause irreparable harm that cannot be undone through post-breach remediation. Reporting failures and most operational covenant breaches are typically curable within specified periods, allowing borrowers to address oversights or operational shortcomings without triggering defaults provided they act promptly to restore compliance after receiving notice of breaches.

Fundamental covenant breaches including violations of bankruptcy remoteness provisions, unauthorised fundamental changes, or fraudulent conduct generally constitute immediate events of default without cure rights, reflecting assessment that these categories of breach either indicate bad faith warranting immediate consequences or cause irreversible structural harm that cannot be addressed through subsequent compliance efforts. The prohibition on cures for fundamental breaches prevents borrowers from temporarily violating important structural protections while pursuing other objectives and then invoking cure rights to avoid default consequences after completing actions that served borrower purposes at expense of noteholder protections.

The concept of materiality qualifiers in covenant default provisions requires that breaches have or be reasonably likely to have material adverse effects before constituting events of default, filtering out technical violations of covenant provisions that have no genuine impact on noteholder credit risk or security interests. The application of materiality standards creates interpretive challenges regarding threshold levels constituting materiality and regarding burden of proof issues about whether noteholders must demonstrate materiality or whether borrowers must demonstrate immateriality, with transaction documents typically resolving these issues through explicit materiality definitions or safe harbour provisions that establish presumptive materiality levels eliminating need for case-by-case factual determinations.

### **7.3 Representation Defaults**

Material misrepresentation or breach of warranty constitutes event of default when representations prove to have been incorrect when made, subject to materiality thresholds and curability analysis similar to covenant breaches. The representation default provisions reflect principle that noteholders relied on accuracy of borrower representations in deciding to extend credit and in calibrating pricing and structural protections, making material misrepresentations forms of fraud or at minimum material breach of contract that justify protective remedies including potential acceleration and enforcement. The assessment of whether particular misrepresentations rise to level of default-triggering materiality requires consideration of quantitative impact on collateral value or borrowing base calculations together with qualitative assessment of whether misrepresentation relates to fundamental aspects of transaction structure or borrower creditworthiness.

Certain categories of representations including those relating to litigation, regulatory compliance, or title and lien status may be capable of cure if underlying facts can be remedied to conform to represented state, such as by settling pending litigation, obtaining required regulatory approvals, or eliminating undisclosed liens. Other representations including those relating to historical facts or to accuracy of information provided to noteholders may be inherently incurable because past facts cannot be changed and because noteholders have already committed capital based on incorrect information, meaning that borrower cannot restore status quo ante even through diligent post-discovery remediation efforts. The transaction documents address curability of representation breaches through specific provisions identifying which categories admit cure and establishing cure procedures and deadlines for different types of correctable misrepresentations.

### **7.4 Cross-Default Provisions**

Cross-default provisions render defaults under other material indebtedness of CarCo into events of default under the note obligations, preventing scenarios where CarCo might remain current on note payments while defaulting on other material obligations, potentially to facilitate strategic negotiations with alternative creditor constituencies or to preferentially favour some creditors over others. The cross-default mechanism ensures that noteholders become aware of and can respond to financial distress manifesting through defaults under other obligations rather than being isolated from information about parallel problems, while the materiality threshold for triggering cross-defaults prevents technical defaults on immaterial obligations from cascading into defaults under the notes that could precipitate facility-wide consequences disproportionate to actual significance of underlying triggering event.

The definition of material indebtedness triggering cross-defaults typically employs monetary thresholds measured by principal amount outstanding or maximum exposure under committed facilities, rather than attempting qualitative assessments of strategic importance of particular obligations. This quantitative approach provides bright-line clarity about what obligations are covered by cross-default provisions while capturing the economically significant debt relationships that noteholders would want visibility into through cross-default mechanisms. The calibration of monetary thresholds reflects balance between capturing genuinely material obligations and avoiding technical cross-defaults from defaults on routine trade debt or minor equipment financing that lack real significance to overall credit profile.

### **7.5 Insolvency Defaults**

Insolvency events including bankruptcy filings, receivership appointments, or admissions of inability to pay debts constitute immediate events of default without grace periods or cure rights, reflecting the fundamental incompatibility between ongoing insolvency proceedings and continuation of normal contractual obligations under financing documents. The automatic default upon insolvency protects noteholders’ rights to immediate acceleration and enforcement rather than potentially subordinating their claims to statutory insolvency procedures that might result in outcomes less favourable than contractual remedies available under transaction documents. The speed of insolvency default triggers reflects practical recognition that rapid action may be necessary to preserve value and protect security interests when obligors enter insolvency, as delays in responding to insolvency situations can result in asset dissipation or competing claims from other creditors or insolvency officials.

The inclusion of detailed definition provisions identifying various types of insolvency events across multiple jurisdictions reflects the cross-border nature of AUTO1’s operations and the variety of insolvency regimes that might apply depending on circumstances and jurisdictions involved. The definitional provisions attempt to capture functional equivalents of formal bankruptcy across different legal systems, recognising that insolvency procedures vary in nomenclature and precise requirements across European jurisdictions but share common characteristics of judicial oversight over insolvent entities, potential displacement of management, and deviation from normal contractual enforcement that warrant treating all forms of insolvency proceedings as triggering default rights.

The bankruptcy remoteness structural features incorporated in CarCo’s organisational documents are specifically designed to prevent insolvency defaults from occurring absent extraordinary circumstances, making insolvency defaults largely theoretical protections that serve primarily as backstops against structural failure or legal re-characterisation rather than as likely triggers under normal stress scenarios. The existence of independent director approval requirements and prohibitions on voluntary bankruptcy filings means that CarCo insolvency would most likely result from involuntary bankruptcy petitions filed by creditors or from judicial determinations of insolvency in contexts where CarCo’s structural protections prove ineffective, representing tail risk scenarios rather than central case concerns.

### **7.6 Material Adverse Effect Defaults**

The occurrence of events having material adverse effects on CarCo’s business, financial condition, or ability to perform obligations, or on validity and enforceability of transaction documents or security interests, constitutes events of default subject to curability analysis and materiality determinations. The material adverse effect default provision functions as catch-all protection capturing situations that might not fit within specific enumerated default categories but that nonetheless represent fundamental problems threatening noteholder interests warranting default remedies. The inherent imprecision of material adverse effect standards creates interpretive challenges and potential disputes about whether particular events rise to requisite materiality level, making material adverse effect provisions somewhat uncertain in application compared to mechanical payment defaults or bright-line insolvency triggers.

Common examples of events potentially constituting material adverse effects include regulatory changes prohibiting or materially restricting CarCo’s business activities, litigation resulting in judgments that impair financial capacity or operational capabilities, force majeure events preventing normal operations for extended periods, or market disruptions that fundamentally undermine business model viability. The assessment of materiality typically requires holistic evaluation considering magnitude of impact, duration of effects, and availability of mitigation measures or alternative strategies that might ameliorate harm, with short-term or easily remediated problems unlikely to meet materiality thresholds while persistent or irreversible harm to core business capabilities more clearly satisfying default standards.

### **7.7 Consequences of Default and Acceleration**

Upon occurrence and continuation of events of default, noteholders through majority vote may declare notes immediately due and payable, cancel all commitments, and instruct the security trustee to enforce security interests through foreclosure, receivership appointment, or other available remedies under applicable law and transaction documents. The acceleration mechanism converts future obligations into present obligations, enabling noteholders to pursue immediate recovery of outstanding principal plus accrued interest rather than being bound to original maturity schedules that might extend years into the future. The requirement for majority noteholder action before acceleration reflects balance between protecting individual noteholder rights and preventing single disgruntled noteholders from triggering facility-wide consequences that might not serve collective creditor interests.

Automatic acceleration provisions applicable to certain severe default categories including insolvency and final maturity payment failures eliminate the need for affirmative noteholder action to trigger acceleration, recognising that delay in responding to most severe forms of default might harm recovery prospects and that collective action challenges might impede prompt response if formal voting processes were required. The automatic nature of acceleration in these contexts ensures immediate consequences follow from defaults representing fundamental failure or terminal inability to perform, while the restriction of automatic acceleration to limited categories of most severe defaults preserves noteholder flexibility to assess appropriate responses to less severe defaults where acceleration might not represent optimal strategy.

The mechanics of distributing enforcement proceeds following acceleration and enforcement follow specified priority of payments that maintain class seniority with senior notes receiving full recovery of principal and interest before mezzanine notes receive any distributions, and mezzanine notes receiving full recovery before junior notes participate in proceeds. This sequential distribution differs from pro rata sharing that might apply among creditors of equal priority, reflecting contractual subordination arrangements that intentionally create payment hierarchy allocating loss absorption capacity to junior classes while protecting senior noteholders. The post-enforcement priority of payments typically simplifies compared to ongoing operational priorities by eliminating provisions related to facility operations, reserve funding, and other provisions relevant only to continuing business that become inapplicable once enforcement transforms the transaction into liquidation scenario.

## **8. SERVICER TERMINATION EVENTS**

### **8.1 Role and Criticality of Servicer**

The servicer performs mission-critical functions including vehicle acquisition, inventory management, sales execution, collection of proceeds, and all operational reporting required under transaction documents, making servicer performance essential to portfolio value preservation and noteholder recoveries. AUTO1 Group’s role as servicer leverages proprietary technology platforms, established relationships with pan-European buyer networks, pricing algorithms refined through years of transaction data, and operational expertise in logistics and vehicle reconditioning that would be difficult for alternative servicers to replicate in short timeframes. The transaction structure recognises servicer criticality through detailed servicer termination provisions designed to detect servicer performance problems early and enable orderly transition to backup servicer before problems escalate to levels threatening portfolio viability.

The fundamental tension in servicer relationship derives from servicer’s status as affiliate of junior noteholder with economic interests potentially misaligned with senior and mezzanine noteholders particularly during stress scenarios where servicer might prioritise preservation of junior value through aggressive portfolio management strategies that senior noteholders might view as excessively risky. The servicer covenants and termination provisions attempt to manage this conflict through contractual requirements that servicer maintain servicing standards comparable to treatment of servicer’s proprietary inventory, mandatory reporting providing transparency into servicing activities, and termination rights triggered by objective performance failures or financial distress indicators rather than requiring proof of intentional misconduct that might be difficult to establish.

### **8.2 Servicer Insolvency and Financial Distress**

Servicer insolvency constitutes automatic servicer termination event without cure rights or grace periods, reflecting assessment that servicer’s entry into bankruptcy or analogous insolvency proceedings fundamentally impairs servicer’s ability to perform operational duties and creates unacceptable uncertainty about continuity of critical services. Insolvency would likely result in appointment of insolvency officials with legal authority to repudiate contracts and cease non-profitable activities, potentially including servicing obligations that might not generate positive cash flow for servicer separate from broader AUTO1 Group economics. The automatic termination protects noteholders from being forced to rely on insolvent servicer performing duties under insolvency court supervision with uncertain priorities and incentives potentially misaligned with value maximisation for pledged collateral.

Financial covenant breaches by servicer parent company trigger servicer review processes rather than automatic termination, recognising that breaches of consolidated financial metrics might result from factors unrelated to servicing operations and that parent company financial stress does not necessarily indicate immediate inability to perform servicing functions provided that servicing operations remain adequately staffed and funded. The servicer review process permits noteholders to assess whether financial covenant breaches reflect temporary conditions readily remediable through capital raises or operational adjustments, or whether breaches signal fundamental deterioration threatening servicer’s viability and warranting transition to backup servicer despite operational disruption costs. This graduated approach balances protection against servicer failure with recognition that premature servicer replacement could itself cause value destruction through loss of institutional knowledge and buyer relationships.

### **8.3 Collection and Remittance Failures**

Failure to remit collections to segregated collection accounts within contractually specified timeframes constitutes servicer termination event when breaches exceed materiality thresholds or become part of patterns indicating systematic collection dysfunction. The strict remittance timing requirements serve dual purposes of preventing commingling risk where CarCo collections might become entangled with servicer or parent company funds, and providing early detection of servicer liquidity stress that might manifest through delayed remittances as servicer attempts to use collections as informal working capital financing. Single isolated remittance delays within grace periods are typically viewed as administrative errors not warranting servicer termination, while repeated delays or single delays involving material amounts trigger termination rights based on assessment that remittance failures indicate either operational incompetence or potential misappropriation requiring immediate protective response.

The mechanism for detecting remittance failures relies on comparison between reported sales transactions that should generate collection obligations and actual deposits into collection accounts, with discrepancies either indicating unreported sales where proceeds were not remitted, or delayed remittances of reported sales where procedural failures prevented timely deposit. The reporting requirements designed to enable this monitoring require sufficient granularity to match individual sale transactions to specific collection deposits, preventing servicer from potentially obscuring remittance failures through aggregated reporting that might mask timing delays or selective remittances favouring servicer interests. The combination of detailed transaction-level reporting and short permitted remittance timeframes creates reasonably robust monitoring framework enabling detection of collection problems before they escalate to material value impairment.

### **8.4 Servicer Performance Failures**

Material failures to maintain servicing standards or to perform obligations under servicing agreements constitute termination events subject to cure periods and materiality determinations recognising that perfect operational execution is unrealistic and that isolated performance shortfalls should not trigger servicer replacement if promptly addressed. The servicing standard requiring treatment of pledged inventory comparable to servicer’s proprietary inventory provides meaningful performance benchmark while acknowledging that servicing quality will reflect servicer’s general operational capabilities rather than achieving perfection impossible even for servicer’s own account. Performance failures potentially rising to termination event level include systematic underperformance in inventory turnover suggesting inadequate marketing efforts or pricing errors, failure to maintain vehicles resulting in condition deterioration and value loss, or inadequate security precautions leading to elevated theft or vandalism losses.

The assessment of whether particular performance failures warrant servicer termination requires balancing the operational disruption and transition costs associated with servicer replacement against the ongoing value destruction from continued poor performance if servicer is retained. Isolated incidents or problems in limited portfolio segments might warrant remediation demands and enhanced monitoring rather than immediate termination, while systemic performance failures across entire portfolio or repeated failures after previous warnings more clearly justify termination conclusions. The provision of cure periods for many categories of performance failures reflects judgment that servicer should have opportunity to address identified deficiencies through corrective action before suffering termination consequences, though cure rights are denied for most serious categories of performance failure including fraud, gross negligence, or wilful misconduct indicating bad faith or recklessness incompatible with continued servicing relationship.

### **8.5 Change of Control and Strategic Events**

Change of control of the servicer parent company without noteholder consent constitutes servicer termination event based on principle that noteholders underwrote servicing risk based on existing management capabilities and strategic direction, with acquisition by different parties potentially altering servicer priorities or capabilities in ways that noteholders might reasonably find unacceptable. The change of control provisions typically define triggering events to include equity ownership changes exceeding specified thresholds, management changes involving replacement of substantial portions of key leadership, or asset sales transferring material portions of business operations to third parties. The requirement for advance noteholder approval of change of control transactions provides noteholders opportunity to evaluate proposed acquirers or new strategic direction and either consent to changes if they conclude continuity of servicing quality is likely, or exercise termination rights to transition servicing to backup servicer before changes that might prove detrimental are consummated.

Material changes to servicer business model or strategic focus even absent formal change of control might also trigger servicer review rights if changes materially impact servicer’s capabilities or commitment to perform servicing obligations at expected quality levels. Examples might include servicer decision to exit automotive business and pursue unrelated opportunities, servicer decision to shift from wholesale focus toward retail orientation that might reduce attention to wholesale inventory management critical to CarCo’s operations, or servicer international expansion that might divert management attention and resources away from core European markets where CarCo operates. The assessment of whether strategic changes warrant servicer termination requires judgment about materiality of changes and degree to which changes actually impair rather than merely alter servicing approaches.

### **8.6 Backup Servicer Transition and Continuity Risk**

Upon servicer termination, the pre-designated backup servicer assumes servicing obligations through contractually defined transition procedures designed to minimise operational disruption and preserve portfolio value during changeover period. The backup servicing agreement executed at closing establishes backup servicer’s standby obligations and provides for warm handover procedures including periodic access to systems and data enabling backup servicer to maintain readiness for potential activation. The transition timeline typically provides short periods measured in business days for backup servicer to assume operational control, recognising that extended transition periods create value leakage risk through operational drift and potential collection failures during uncertain handover intervals.

The quality and capabilities of backup servicer represent critical considerations in evaluating transaction risk, as backup servicer must possess sufficient operational capabilities, technology infrastructure, and market access to maintain servicer functions at quality levels reasonably approximating terminated servicer’s performance. The selection of backup servicers typically focuses on major financial institutions with automotive servicing experience or specialised automotive asset managers with established platforms and proven capabilities, avoiding backup servicer designations that represent paper commitments without genuine operational capacity to assume duties if called upon. The backup servicer fee structure typically provides for materially higher servicing compensation than paid to primary servicer, reflecting standalone operating costs without benefit of shared services with parent company and reflecting risk premium for assuming troubled portfolio.

The scenario where backup servicer proves unwilling or unable to perform despite contractual commitments represents severe tail risk potentially triggering immediate early amortisation or enforcement if no viable servicing alternative exists. The transaction documents generally provide that security trustee may appoint receivers or engage alternative servicers on emergency basis if backup servicer fails to perform, though practical challenges of identifying and onboarding replacement servicers during crisis situations make this contingency plan of uncertain effectiveness. The realistic assessment suggests that backup servicer failure would likely force either rapid bulk liquidation of portfolio to institutional buyers capable of assuming inventory, or transition to full enforcement scenario where security trustee exercises control and pursues liquidation through available channels potentially including auction houses or other wholesale disposal mechanisms accepting inventory in current condition without ongoing servicing support.
