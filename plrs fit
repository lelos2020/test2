What this call was about
	•	A catch-up between the deal team and Fitch to understand what actually binds the Polaris structure from a ratings/modelling perspective, and what levers might improve outcomes (especially mezz/junior).

Fitch’s key takeaways on the prior Polaris
	•	Fitch views Polaris as a fairly standard structure with no obvious structural “hole” that creates a step-change weakness across scenarios.
	•	The main rating sensitivity driver (especially for mezz/junior) was the “rates down / high CPR” type dynamic, because it interacts with the swap notional / over-hedge profile. In short: the swap/hedge mechanics can become the binding constraint at the margin, rather than a classic structural deficiency.

Swap notional / CPR stress discussion
	•	The team asked whether moving to a more balanced swap notional would reduce the “over-hedge driven shortfall.” Fitch’s response: likely yes in principle, but they’d need to analyse it.
	•	On whether Fitch layers an additional CPR stress on top of the deal’s embedded/scheduled CPR assumption used for swap notional:
	•	Fitch indicated they treat the scheduled notional / embedded CPR as given and do not separately “stress CPR beyond that” just to cancel it out.
	•	Fitch described an internal simplification/assumption approach:
	•	They model a scenario where a meaningful fixed-rate portion is retained (the call references ~25% retention), which keeps the hedge in place longer and reduces excess spread (because hedging cost persists instead of reverting to a floating coupon).
	•	They then assume the retained portion is effectively hedged on a 0% CPR schedule for modelling simplicity (with a caveat that real-life hedge profiles may have small built-in assumptions).

Liquidity reserve (LRF) mechanics
	•	A notable structural feature: the liquidity reserve is not funded at closing; it builds from principal in the first periods.
	•	Fitch’s focus here is operational/modelling: how quickly it can reach target from available principal and whether there is any extended period with no liquidity support.
	•	The team asked whether “principal could be lost” if the reserve is drawn and not replenished, and whether that drives junior CE in stress.
	•	Fitch response: in the rating scenarios where junior notes are under pressure, the liquidity reserve generally isn’t the driver (often it’s not drawn in those scenarios), so it’s largely a non-factor for junior ratings—more of a theoretical risk.

What drives junior ratings: liquidity/timing vs losses
	•	The team asked whether junior breaks are driven by liquidity/timing constraints.
	•	Fitch: junior stress outcomes are more loss-driven than timing/liquidity-driven.
	•	On timely vs ultimate payment treatment:
	•	Fitch reiterated the general approach: AAA is typically modelled as timely (supported by liquidity while it is the most senior). Lower classes can be allowed to defer while not most senior, depending on transaction documents; once a class becomes the most senior, timeliness expectations increase.

Reserve sizing sensitivity
	•	The team explored whether reducing the reserve size could be feasible.
	•	Fitch cautioned that if the deal is already on the lower end of what they see for payment-interruption protection, reducing it further could pressure the payment interruption tests (even if credit break-evens show buffer elsewhere).

Originator adjustment (performance/quality adjustment)
	•	The team asked what could change Fitch’s originator adjustment going forward.
	•	Fitch: changes are more plausible when an originator transitions from being “newer/less established” to more seasoned with demonstrably improved performance and operational maturity.
	•	For this transaction: the prior deal was very recent, and the product/borrower targeting driving the adjustment is not expected to have changed materially, so Fitch did not expect movement.
	•	Fitch also noted their modelling “starting point” is a prime benchmark/matrix, so the adjustment helps align assumptions to the originator’s actual underwriting segment/performance rather than a clean high-street prime baseline.

Prefunding / ramp modelling
	•	The team asked how Fitch models prefunding and whether they assume ramp risk or negative carry.
	•	Fitch: they assume prefunding completes (i.e., no ramp failure stress). If it didn’t complete, Fitch noted the deal could even look “better off” under some mechanics, but that’s not their base assumption.
	•	For Polaris, they described a process where they were kept updated on the pipeline during ramp, checked limits vs pipeline, and because visibility was good and eligibility wasn’t materially wider than the observed pool, they did not apply an additional “portfolio quality drift” stress. WA metrics (WAFF/WALS context) were said to be broadly stable through ramp.


----------------------------------------------------------

Constraints the speaker flags as binding (ratings / modelling)
	•	Primary binding stress for mezz & junior notes: “rates down + high CPR”
	•	They explicitly say the constraining run for mezz/juniors is a rates-down, high prepayment (high CPR) stress, because it causes spread compression (fixed-rate loans reset to a lower rate) and reduces available excess spread.
	•	Mechanism they describe: seniors repay sooner in high CPR scenarios, leaving juniors outstanding and having to rely on lower post-reversion excess spread / cash available, which makes them more vulnerable.
	•	High-CPR calibration / severity
	•	They indicate they run high CPR levels (they mention ~40% for this deal; also referencing 40–45–50% in similar cases) to capture the interaction of interest-rate reversion concentration and spread compression.
	•	For the affected notes, failure is mainly credit loss (principal loss), not liquidity
	•	When asked whether the junior constraint is credit vs liquidity: they say it is predominantly credit (principal loss) driving the break for the relevant classes in their stress outcomes.
	•	Lowest notes (F/G) are constrained to very low ratings due to high CPR + low available spread/liquidity
	•	They state the F and G notes are predominantly driven by high CPR because, after reversion, there is insufficient excess spread / cash available, so they “fail to achieve any rating,” ending up in B- / CCC territory.

Structural / cashflow constraints discussed (secondary)
	•	Liquidity Reserve Fund (LRF): initially unfunded; builds from principal
	•	They describe the LRF as unfunded at closing and funded over time from principal collections until it reaches the required target.
	•	Constraint implication: Day-1 liquidity is lower, and the model “dictates” how quickly it builds, meaning early-period liquidity support is limited versus a day-1 funded reserve.
	•	LRF sizing change vs prior deal reduces day-1 liquidity
	•	They highlight a structural difference vs Polaris 2025-2:
	•	Prior: LRF target was maximum of 1% of Class A and Class B.
	•	This deal: maximum of 1% of Class A or Class B (as they recall).
	•	Their point: this change means lower LRF available initially, i.e., slightly weaker day-1 liquidity support.
	•	LRF amortisation dynamic
	•	They explain LRF shrinks as Class A amortises, and once Class A falls below Class B, the Class B balance drives the LRF target, so the reserve tracks the larger of A/B over time (per their recollection of the “or”/“maximum” mechanic).

Swap / hedging constraint (not flagged as binding, but monitored)
	•	Swap can be beneficial in rising-rate scenarios and harmful in low-rate / over-hedged scenarios
	•	They acknowledge over-hedge risk: in a low-rate environment, if over-hedged, the SPV could pay “too much” on the swap relative to what it receives, which hurts cashflows and would be captured in the runs.
	•	But they do not present the swap as the key binding constraint here; they say the swap is structured in line with criteria and they do give credit to it.

Call / step-up modelling constraint
	•	They do NOT assume the call is exercised; they DO model step-up coupons (no-call)
	•	Because the call is not contractual/mandatory, they assume no call, and model step-up margins/coupons continuing. This can constrain juniors because it extends exposure into the post-reversion period where spread may be lower.

Other items they mention but downplay as binding
	•	Prefunding negative carry
	•	They note prefunding can introduce negative carry, but in this case it was limited and not stressed (so not a binding driver here).
	•	Product switches
	•	They stress product switches as an additional spread-compression vector, but say it was not driving ratings for Classes K through E; it is more relevant to the very junior notes in combination with high CPR / reversion timing.
Practical “where to look” for buffer
	•	Fitch suggested using the presale / new issue report sensitivity tables to infer how much buffer there is (they could not discuss break-even detail on the call).

End of call
	•	The call wrapped with logistics (people being out for holidays) and an agreement to follow up later if needed.
