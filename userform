To integrate an ActiveX form in Excel VBA that can display and allow users to change settings currently held in a "Control" worksheet, youâ€™ll need to create a user interface that fetches existing settings from the worksheet, displays them, allows users to modify them, and then saves those modifications back to the worksheet. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Step 1: Create an ActiveX UserForm
1. **Open VBA Editor**: Press `ALT + F11` in Excel.
2. **Insert a UserForm**:
   - Right-click on `VBAProject (YourWorkbookName)` in the Project Explorer.
   - Select `Insert` -> `UserForm`.
3. **Design the UserForm**:
   - Add Labels, TextBoxes, or ComboBoxes depending on the type of settings you have. For example, if you have a setting for "Interest Rate Type", you might add a ComboBox to select between different types.
   - Add CommandButtons for actions like "Save", "Cancel", or "Apply".

### Step 2: Populate the Form with Existing Settings
You'll need to write a subroutine that loads when the form initializes to populate the form controls with values from the "Control" sheet.

```vba
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
    ' Assuming settings are in columns A (labels) and B (values) in the Control sheet
    Dim wsControl As Worksheet
    Set wsControl = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Control")
    Dim lastRow As Long
    lastRow = wsControl.Cells(wsControl.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
    Dim i As Integer

    For i = 2 To lastRow
        Me.Controls("txt" & wsControl.Cells(i, 1).Value).Value = wsControl.Cells(i, 2).Value
    Next i
End Sub
```
In this code, it's assumed that each control on the UserForm has a name that corresponds with the setting names prefixed with "txt" (for TextBoxes). Adjust the prefix and control type accordingly.

### Step 3: Save Changes Back to the Control Worksheet
Add a subroutine linked to the "Save" button which will save the changes back to the worksheet.

```vba
Private Sub btnSave_Click()
    Dim wsControl As Worksheet
    Set wsControl = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Control")
    Dim lastRow As Long
    lastRow = wsControl.Cells(wsControl.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
    Dim i As Integer

    For i = 2 To lastRow
        wsControl.Cells(i, 2).Value = Me.Controls("txt" & wsControl.Cells(i, 1).Value).Value
    Next i

    Me.Hide ' Optionally hide or unload the form after saving
End Sub
```

### Step 4: Link the UserForm to Excel
Create a subroutine in a standard module that can open this form, usually triggered by a button on your Excel sheet.

```vba
Sub OpenSettingsForm()
    UserForm1.Show
End Sub
```

### Step 5: Add Error Handling and Validation
Consider adding error handling to check for invalid data or exceptions when writing to the worksheet. You might also want to add data validation before saving data back to the worksheet to ensure data integrity.

```vba
Private Sub btnSave_Click()
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    ' Save logic here
    Me.Hide
    Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:
    MsgBox "An error occurred: " & Err.Description
End Sub
```

### Final Thoughts
Make sure to adapt the UserForm control names, data types, and error handling according to the specific settings and validation rules that fit your project requirements. This approach gives you a dynamic way to manage configuration settings directly from within an Excel interface, making it user-friendly for non-technical users.
