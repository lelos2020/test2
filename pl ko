Kick-off call summary (new deal; recording for VDR)

Timing / process
	•	This was the kick-off call for a new transaction; the call is being recorded and uploaded to the data room (VDR).
	•	Target launch: end of January, specifically week of 26 January.
	•	Indicative internal timing:
	•	Pre-funding limits to be shared early next week (aiming for Monday).
	•	Pre-committee / early asset feedback expected mid-next week (Tue/Wed) if the deal remains consistent with last time.
	•	Committee likely week of 5 January (view expressed that the pre-funding indication shouldn’t realistically change at committee).
	•	Liability structure to be sent over around the week of 29 December / end of that week.

Structure
	•	Expectation is the transaction will look very similar to the previous deal:
	•	Liability structure: intended to be the same as last time.
	•	Counterparties: expected to remain the same.
	•	Swap counterparty: TBD, but the swap itself is still expected to be in place.

Assets / portfolio cuts / deal size
	•	Assets are expected to be fresh originations (explicitly no “ramp” / no re-loading of seasoned assets).
	•	Current pool sizing and planned tape evolution:
	•	November cut: ~£120m pool (as of November).
	•	December cut: expected ~£250m.
	•	Early/mid-January cut: first/second week of January to add additional originations.
	•	Mid-January cut: becomes the provisional pool, with pre-funding on top.
	•	Expected final deal size: approximately £350m–£400m.
	•	Pre-funding: expected around 25%–30% (similar to last year); expectation that the tightness/limits will also be similar.

Performance / data / audit
	•	Loan-level data and the pre-funding pool will be uploaded to the VDR.
	•	Audit / AUP sampling: they plan to run the audit off the end-November tape.
	•	Sample size expected to remain 400 loans, even though the pool is smaller at that point (fewer loans originated so far).
	•	View expressed that this should be fine given prior AUP history and no expectation of major origination changes.
	•	Additional info noted as important: they will have six months of performance available (to support the analysis/ratings work).

Availability / coverage
	•	One participant is not working most of next week, but is around Tue/Wed after being out Monday.
	•	They are out the week of 29 December, but coverage will be arranged and communicated next week.
