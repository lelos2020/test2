AUTO1 – Executive Snapshot (Very Brief)

Company (what it is)
	•	Pan-EU digital used-car platform (AUTO1.com B2B; Autohero retail).
	•	Asset-light sales model; inventory held in ring-fenced CarCo entities.

Opportunity (what we’re doing)
	•	Senior secured investment in a securitised floorplan: Issuer lends to CarCo to buy inventory; vehicles & collection accounts pledged; dynamic borrowing base sized off days-on-inventory (DOI).
	•	Revolving during Availability Period; turbo-sequential amortisation thereafter.

Strengths (why this works)
	•	Self-liquidating collateral with frequent sales cycle; cash paid into pledged accounts.
	•	Dynamic advance-rate/CE tied to DOI + hard eligibility (≤300 days), limiting ageing risk.
	•	Liquidity package: rate-linked Senior Interest Reserve; required interest-rate caps; VAT/Tax reserves.
	•	Operational backstops: warm back-up servicer; audit/reporting; downgrade/replace for banks/hedges.
	•	Non-recourse structure; true-sale/first-lien security across key jurisdictions.

Weaknesses / Key risks (to watch)
	•	Used-car price volatility (MVD) and slower payment rate could pressure recoveries.
	•	Multi-jurisdiction perfection/portability adds operational/legal execution risk.
	•	Sold-out-of-trust / SNP timing exposure within reserved-inventory window.
	•	FX/settlement frictions (SEK/other currencies) and counterparty replacement risk.
	•	Reliance on servicer performance; BUS mitigates but does not eliminate transition risk.

If you want this formatted as a one-slide IC summary, I can drop it into a clean template.
