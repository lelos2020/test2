Risk	Mitigant / Structural Protection	Source Agency
**Residual Value (RV) Risk**	Credit enhancement is sized to withstand stresses on RV losses from returned vehicles on PCP contracts . KBRA's cash flow modeling assumes higher turn-in rates in scenarios with declining used car prices .	S&P, KBRA
**Commingling Risk**	A servicer advance mechanism is in place, requiring VWFS UK to advance funds if its parent's credit rating falls below investment grade . S&P notes this risk is fully mitigated by this mechanism .	S&P, KBRA
**Revolving Period Credit Drift**	The transaction has structural mitigants, including a cap on used PCP loans (max 55%) and performance triggers that end the replenishment period if performance deteriorates . Fitch notes the class A Overcollateralization (OC) trigger is the most effective performance measure .	S&P, Fitch
**Payment Interruption**	A liquidity reserve, sized at **1.45%** of the outstanding notes, is available to cover senior fees and interest on Class A and B notes . Fitch deems this adequate to cover **2.7 months** of payments, mitigating the risk from a potential servicer disruption .	Fitch, S&P
**Lack of Excess Spread**	The transaction is structured with a purchase price discount on the receivables instead of excess spread. An interest compensation reserve is available to cover shortfalls from prepayments . Upon a Credit Enhancement Increase Condition (CEIC), the interest compensation ledger balance becomes available funds .	S&P, Fitch
**Voluntary Termination (VT)**	Potential losses from borrowers exercising their VT rights under the UK Consumer Credit Act are incorporated into the agencies' base-case gross loss assumptions .	S&P
**Legal Title to Vehicles**	The Issuer does not hold title to the vehicles. To mitigate risk in an insolvency scenario, the servicing agreement includes an administrator recovery incentive fee, which KBRA has stressed in its analysis to ensure cooperation from a potential liquidator .	KBRA
**Interest Rate Risk**	To hedge the risk between the fixed-rate receivables and the floating-rate notes (based on SONIA), the Issuer has entered into an interest rate swap agreement .	KBRA

Why VW Collateral Is Unlikely to Fail the TestWhile the specific commission structures for the Volkswagen Financial Services (VWFS) receivables are not detailed in the provided documents, the operational context suggests a low probability of these loans being deemed unfair. The business model of a captive finance company like VWFS differs significantly from the third-party broker model scrutinized in the Johnson case.Key Insight: The relationship between VWFS and its customers is fundamentally different from the one deemed unfair by the Supreme Court. VWFS operates as a direct, branded lender supporting the sales of its parent company's vehicles, not as an intermediary creating a "false impression" of shopping the market.Here's why the VWFS collateral is likely to withstand scrutiny:Integrated Business Model: VWFS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volkswagen Group, working directly with a network of approximately 800 branded dealerships . This is a captive finance relationship, where the consumer understands they are getting financing from the manufacturer's financial arm. There is no pretense of the dealer being an independent broker, a key factor in the Johnson unfairness finding .Standardized and Professional Underwriting: VWFS employs a sophisticated, in-house credit application system that uses data from major credit agencies like Experian and TransUnion . Its process includes automated scoring, risk banding, and fraud checks. This indicates a standardized, professional lending operation, not one likely to use the type of extremely high, undisclosed commissions that would be considered egregious.Reputational and Brand Risk: As the second-largest finance subsidiary within the entire Volkswagen Group, VWFS has a strong incentive to protect the brand's reputation . Engaging in practices that would lead to widespread findings of "unfair relationships" would cause significant damage to the Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche brands it supports, a risk a major captive lender is unlikely to take.Based on these operational characteristics, the commission structures within the VWFS collateral pool are expected to be in line with standard industry practice for captive finance, making it highly improbable that they would meet the high threshold for unfairness established by the Supreme Court.
