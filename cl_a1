## **PART 1: TRANSACTION STRUCTURE & CAPITAL STACK**

### **(A) Facts and Inputs**

**Structure:**
- Two-tier financing: Issuer (AUTO1 Funding B.V.) → CarCo loans → Vehicle purchases
- Up to EUR 500m facility (senior EUR 400m / mezzanine EUR 50m / junior EUR 50m)
- Revolving period: 24 months (extendable 12 months with noteholder consent)
- Amortisation period: 18 months post-revolving
- Legal final maturity: 31 July 2024
- Bi-weekly adjustments for senior/mezzanine; daily adjustments for junior
- Collateral: Used vehicle inventory across 9 eligible jurisdictions (Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Sweden)

**Capital Structure & Advance Rates:**
- **Senior Notes:** Up to 80% of Net Borrowing Base | 1M Euribor + 175bps | Minimum subordination 20%
- **Mezzanine Notes:** Up to 10% of Net Borrowing Base | 1M Euribor + 450bps | Minimum subordination 10%
- **Junior Notes:** Residual (ineligible vehicles, reserves, excess) | 5.00% fixed | Unrated

**Borrowing Base Mechanism:**
- Gross Borrowing Base = aggregate purchase price of eligible vehicles
- Net Borrowing Base = Gross BB less: ineligible vehicles, excess concentration, dilutions, market value adjustments for ageing
- Daily BB calculation determines drawdown capacity
- Bi-weekly settlement testing (3 business days pre-settlement date)

**Operating Entities:**
- CarCo NL (AUTO1 European Cars B.V.): primary vehicle purchaser
- CarCo IT (AUTO1 Italia Commercio S.r.l.): Italian vehicles during interim period (ended June 2021)
- Intercompany loan structure with netting (no physical cash transfers) mitigates commingling risk

---

### **(B) Observations and Reasoning**

**Structural Strengths:**
1. **Borrowing base discipline** enforces dynamic CE - senior/mezz only finance liquid, value-resilient assets
2. **Two-tier structure** isolates issuer and CarCos (bankruptcy remote SPVs) from AUTO1 operational risk
3. **Netting arrangements** on intercompany loans eliminate cash commingling during capital contributions
4. **Fast inventory turnover** (WA 48 days in inventory at closing) limits market value erosion and provides natural deleveraging

**Key Risks:**
1. **Complex two-tier architecture** requires tight coordination between issuer, CarCos, servicer, and cash manager - operational execution risk
2. **No yield on assets** - all credit support derives from OC, reserves, and recourse to AUTO1 (not cash flow from collateral)
3. **Interest rate exposure** - notes pay floating (1M Euribor), assets generate no indexed yield; mitigated by reserves and AUTO1 support obligation
4. **Revolving period uncertainty** - 24-month revolving creates pool composition migration risk, though constrained by eligibility/replenishment criteria

---

### **(C) Implications and Recommended Actions**

**Senior Lender Perspective:**
- **Minimum 20% subordination floor is structural** - embedded in borrowing base advance rate, not merely a target
- **Daily BB reporting** provides real-time visibility into collateral coverage and breach risk
- **Bi-weekly mandatory amortisation** if notes exceed BB value (5 BD cure) - forces automatic deleveraging if pool deteriorates
- **Monitor:** Auto1's solvency (recourse party), BB compliance, reserve adequacy, trigger breaches

**Critical Questions for Sponsor/Arranger:**
1. What is current utilisation vs. committed (EUR 875m current senior commitment per H1 2025 results vs. original EUR 400m)?
2. Has facility been upsized/refinanced since 2021 closing? (Yes - merchant financing added, public ABS notes issued July 2024)
3. What is AUTO1's current credit profile? (Operating audit 2025 shows 99% documentation success rate, robust controls)

---

## **PART 2: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA & CONCENTRATION LIMITS**

### **(A) Facts and Inputs**

**Core Eligibility Criteria (vehicles must satisfy ALL):**
1. Fully owned by CarCo NL or CarCo IT - full purchase price paid
2. Maximum 300 days in inventory
3. Not subject to any claim, reclamation rights, or retention of title
4. Covered by satisfactory vehicle insurance
5. Located in eligible jurisdiction (DE, FR, ES, IT, NL, BE, AT, PL, SE)
6. Subject to first-ranking security interest (except in transit, Italy, Sweden)
7. Not purchased from sanctioned person
8. Consistent with AUTO1 customary practices

**Replenishment Conditions (Concentration Limits):**

| **Metric** | **Limit** | **Closing Pool (31 Dec 2020)** |
|---|---|---|
| Days 180-300 in inventory | Max 5% | 1% |
| Average days in inventory | Max 70 days | 48 days |
| Vehicle age <2 years | Max 20% | 16% |
| Vehicle age ≤5 years | Max 65% | 58% |
| WA vehicle age | Max 9 years | 6 years |
| Purchase price >EUR 40k | Max 13% | 2% |
| Non-German vehicles | Max 70% | 56% |
| Italian vehicles | Max 20% | 0% |
| **Negative margin countries** | **Max 10%** | **0%** |
| Top 3 brands combined | Max 50% | 32% |
| Brands >4% exposure | Min 6 | 9 |
| Electric vehicles | Max 5% | 1% |
| Remarketing vehicles (on-hand) | Max 5% | 1% |
| Refurbishment investments | Max 6% | 0% |
| Swedish vehicles | Max 10% | 5.6% |

---

### **(B) Observations and Reasoning**

**Eligibility tightness:**
- **300-day cap** creates natural liquidation discipline - forces AUTO1 to sell or refinance stale inventory with junior notes
- **Retention of title exclusion** critical - ensures clean legal title and enforceability of security interest
- **Insurance requirement** mitigates casualty/theft risk during holding period
- **First-ranking security** (except transit/Italy/Sweden) protects against competing claims

**Concentration limits - key constraints:**
1. **10% cap on negative-margin countries** - prevents adverse selection into loss-making geographies
2. **70-day average DoI** - limits ageing/value erosion risk across portfolio
3. **Brand/geography diversification** - reduces single-name and single-market concentration

**Operational audit findings (2025):**
- 99% overall documentation success rate across 537-vehicle sample (9 jurisdictions)
- 161 purchase date discrepancies noted (contract date ≠ BB inclusion date) - **explained by eligibility timing: vehicle only enters BB when fully paid and title perfected**
- No variances on DoI bucketing or vehicle value calculations

---

### **(C) Implications and Recommended Actions**

**For Senior Lender:**
- **Eligibility breaches trigger immediate ineligibility** - vehicle drops out of Net BB, forces senior/mezz amortisation unless AUTO1 provides junior funding
- **Concentration excess similarly haircuts Net BB** - any vehicle above concentration limit excluded from senior/mezz borrowing capacity
- **Request bi-weekly BBR + Settlement Report** - verify calculations, test arithmetic triggers, cross-reference loan balances

**Red Flags to Monitor:**
1. Rising average DoI approaching 70-day limit
2. Build-up of vehicles in 180-300 day bucket (max 5%)
3. Increases in electric vehicle exposure (max 5%) - technological/regulatory risk
4. Any country showing negative 3-month rolling cash trading margin approaching 10% cap

**Legal Diligence Required:**
- Confirm first-ranking security perfection across all 9 jurisdictions (complex multi-jurisdictional regime)
- Verify retention-of-title exclusions in purchase contracts
- Validate insurance adequacy and premium payment controls

---

## **PART 3: SUBORDINATION LEVELS & TRIGGER EVENTS**

### **(A) Facts and Inputs**

**Credit Enhancement Sources:**

1. **Minimum Subordination (Structural Floor):**
   - Senior: 20% minimum (via 80% Senior Advance Rate)
   - Mezzanine: 10% minimum (via 10% Mezzanine Advance Rate, after senior)
   - Enforced through borrowing base - notes cannot exceed BB value

2. **Liquidity Reserves:**
   - **Senior Reserve:** EUR 250k (expenses) + Required Senior Interest Reserve Amount − 20% of Growth Cash
     - Required Senior Interest Reserve % varies with Euribor:
       - If hedged & Euribor ≤0%: 1.05%
       - If hedged & Euribor >0%: 1.10%
       - If unhedged & Euribor ≤0%: 1.75%
     - Targets ~6 months senior interest + expenses
     - Can cure mezz shortfalls if senior notes repaid
   
   - **Mezzanine Reserve:** 1.8% of mezz notes outstanding (targets ~4 months mezz interest)
   
   - **Trade Tax Reserve:** Covers VAT and trade tax liabilities for CarCo

3. **Positive Cash-Trading Margin:**
   - Historical WA margin: 9.2-10.9%
   - Modelled stress: 5.0% (triggers stop-purchase if 3m rolling average falls below)

4. **Recourse to AUTO1:**
   - AUTO1 obligated to cover shortfalls on senior expenses, interest, principal, and reserve top-ups (while solvent)

**Early Amortisation Events (Stop Revolving Triggers):**

| **Trigger** | **Threshold** | **Cure Period** |
|---|---|---|
| **BB shortfall** (senior or mezz notes > BB value) | Any breach | 5 Business Days |
| **Cash trading margin** | 3m rolling avg <5% | Tested bi-weekly, 3 BD pre-settlement |
| **Dilution (Used Vouchers)** | 3m rolling avg >0.90% | As above |
| **Dilution (Closed Claims)** | 3m rolling avg >2.00% | As above |
| **Reserve shortfall** (senior or mezz) | Below required amount | 10 Business Days post-notice |
| CarCo Early Amortisation Event | Per CarCo loan agreements | Immediate |
| Servicer insolvency / BUS activation | Insolvency event occurs | Immediate |
| Issuer security invalidity | Security unenforceable | 15 Business Days |
| Issuer material breach | Covenant default | 15 Business Days |
| CarCo discontinues business / payment default | Missed payment | 10 Business Days |

**Enforcement Events (Acceleration):**

**CarCo Enforcement Event:**
- CarCo insolvency event; **OR**
- Missed payment (interest/principal/mandatory prepayment) uncured for 15 Business Days

**Issuer Enforcement Event:**
- Non-payment on notes (prior to maturity) uncured per relevant grace periods; **OR**
- Non-payment on maturity date; **OR**
- Issuer insolvency; **OR**
- Material breach/security invalidity uncured within specified periods

**Current Performance (Q1 2025 BBRs per Operating Audit):**

| **Trigger** | **Limit** | **Jan 2025** | **Feb 2025** | **Mar 2025** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Used Vouchers (dilution) | Max 0.90% | 0.11% | 0.10% | 0.10% |
| Closed Claims (dilution) | Max 2.00% | 0.99% | 0.99% | 1.01% |
| **Cash Trading Margin** | **Min 5.00%** | **13.67%** | **13.82%** | **14.06%** |
| Sweden purchase concentration | Max 10.00% | 3.00% | 3.00% | 3.18% |

**All triggers performing well within limits - substantial headroom.**

---

### **(B) Observations and Reasoning**

**Subordination Robustness:**
- **Structural enforcement** via borrowing base is superior to covenant-style OC tests - automatic daily adjustment prevents creep
- **20%/10% floors** are meaningful for inventory collateral (no yield, market value risk) - comparable to dealer floorplan structures
- **Reserve quantum appears light** - senior reserve covers only ~6 months interest, mezz only ~4 months - adequate given fast turnover (48-day average) but servicer disruption >6 months would strain liquidity

**Trigger Analysis:**
1. **5% cash margin trigger is the key performance governor** - sits at lower bound of AUTO1's historical range (9.2% historical avg), creates meaningful early warning
2. **Dilution triggers (vouchers 0.90%, claims 2.00%)** address operational risk (warranty claims, purchase price adjustments) - current performance 0.10-1.01% shows good underwriting/QC
3. **BB shortfall = structural breach** - cannot be cured by reserve draw or AUTO1 payment, only by deleveraging notes or adding collateral
4. **Short cure periods (5-15 BD)** accelerate amortisation quickly if triggers breach

**Reserve Mechanics:**
- Senior reserve **dynamically sized** based on Euribor level and hedge status - increases protection if rates rise
- 20% Growth Cash offset provides flexibility for AUTO1 to scale business without immediately increasing reserves
- Reserves can be **used at legal final maturity** to repay principal if liquidation incomplete - provides maturity date protection

**Current Performance - Comfortable:**
- Cash margin 13.67-14.06% vs. 5% trigger = **~900bps headroom**
- Dilution well below limits
- No evidence of trigger breaches in 2025 audit period

---

### **(C) Implications and Recommended Actions**

**For Senior Lender:**

**Strengths:**
- **Multiple layers of CE** (subordination + reserves + margin + AUTO1 recourse) provide defence in depth
- **Borrowing base discipline** creates automatic deleveraging if collateral deteriorates
- **5% margin trigger** likely catches distress early (well before loss scenario)

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reserve sizing** assumes short liquidation period - if BUS activation + forced liquidation takes >6 months, reserves may be exhausted before full amortisation
- **AUTO1 recourse is critical** - if AUTO1 defaults, only available resources are collateral + reserves (no yield on assets)
- **Interest rate risk** material if Euribor rises sharply - reserves increase but assets generate no indexed return (mitigated by AUTO1 support obligation)

**Monitoring Programme:**
1. **Monthly BBR review:**
   - Cash trading margin trend (absolute and 3m rolling average)
   - Dilution trends (vouchers, claims)
   - Days in inventory ageing
   - BB coverage ratios (actual notes / BB value)
2. **Quarterly deep dive:**
   - Reserve adequacy vs. target
   - Concentration limit compliance
   - AUTO1 financial performance (solvency assessment)
3. **Immediate escalation if:**
   - Cash margin 3m avg falls below 7% (early warning, 200bps above trigger)
   - Any trigger cure period invoked
   - Servicer performance issues flagged in operational audit

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Obtain latest BBRs** (post-March 2025) - verify continued performance
- **Model senior loss scenarios:** Assume AUTO1 default at month 12-24, apply rating-conditional collateral haircuts, assess recovery
- **Stress reserves:** Extend liquidation period to 12 months, assess interest/expense coverage adequacy
- **Verify hedge status:** Confirm whether Required Hedging in place (impacts reserve percentage)

## **PART 4: WATERFALL MECHANICS**

### **(A) Facts and Inputs**

**Combined Principal & Interest Waterfall - Pre-Early Amortisation / Pre-Enforcement:**

| **Priority** | **Payment** | **Notes** |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Taxes and fees | Issuer taxes; CarCo taxes (from Trade Tax Reserve if needed); Issuer Profit Amount retention |
| 2 | Senior & Mezz notes: fees, trustee, agents | Transaction expenses |
| 3 | CarCo fees, corporate services provider, rating agency fees | CarCo operational costs |
| 4 | Account bank fees | Cash management |
| 5 | **Junior voluntary prepayments + junior reserve proceeds** | Only if no senior/mezz shortfalls |
| 6 | **Senior notes interest** | Monthly payment |
| 7 | Replenish senior reserve | To target Senior Reserve Amount |
| 8 | **Senior notes mandatory redemption to target BB value** | Bi-weekly during revolving - enforces BB compliance |
| 9 | **Mezzanine notes mandatory redemption to target BB value** | Bi-weekly during revolving |
| 10 | Senior notes voluntary redemption | During revolving period |
| 11 | Mezzanine notes voluntary redemption | During revolving period |
| 12 | **Mezzanine notes interest** | Monthly payment |
| 13 | Replenish mezzanine reserve | To target Mezzanine Reserve Amount |
| 14 | **During amortisation: sequential pay (senior → mezz)** | 18-month amortisation period |
| 15 | Subordinated items | Junior interest, residuals |

**Post-Early Amortisation / Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments:**

**Key Changes:**
1. **Senior interest moves to priority 4** (from priority 6) - increased seniority
2. **Priority 3:** If CarCo Enforcement Event, pay junior noteholders enforcement proceeds from intercompany loans
3. **Priority 6:** Senior notes **principal** (not just mandatory redemption)
4. **Priority 8:** Replenish mezzanine reserve (if mezz notes outstanding)
5. **Priority 9:** Mezzanine notes principal
6. **Sequential amortisation replaces mandatory redemption structure**

**Reserve Application in Waterfall:**
- **Senior Reserve:** Used to cure shortfalls in priorities 1 (partial - Trade Tax only), 2, 3, 4, 6 (senior interest/principal)
  - Also applied on maturity date to pay remaining senior principal if shortfall
  - After senior repaid, can cure mezz interest
- **Mezzanine Reserve:** Used to cure shortfalls in priorities 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (after Trade Tax + Senior Reserve applied), 7 (after senior reserve applied), 9 (mezz interest/principal)
  - Also applied on maturity date to pay remaining mezz principal if shortfall
- **Trade Tax Reserve:** First call for CarCo tax liabilities (priority 1)

---

### **(B) Observations and Reasoning**

**Waterfall Strengths:**
1. **Combined P&I structure** allows principal collections to pay interest - critical for inventory ABS (no yield on assets)
2. **Mandatory redemption (priorities 8-9) enforces BB compliance bi-weekly** - automatic deleveraging mechanism
3. **Reserve replenishment senior to mezz interest** (priority 7 vs. 12) - ensures senior liquidity buffer maintained before mezz paid
4. **Sequential pay in amortisation** (priority 14) - senior fully repaid before mezz receives principal

**Structural Features:**
- **Proceeds from ineligible vehicle sales (priority 5)** go to juniors only if no senior/mezz shortfalls - creates incentive for AUTO1 to maintain eligibility
- **Post-enforcement:** Junior gets intercompany loan enforcement proceeds (priority 3) - recovers junior capital contribution to CarCos
- **Issuer Profit Amount** (priority 1) segregated for distributions to Foundation (orphan SPV structure) - bankruptcy-remote maintenance

**Sequential vs. Pro Rata Mechanics:**
- **Revolving period:** Pro rata funding (senior 80% / mezz 10%) up to BB limits
- **Amortisation period:** Strict sequential (senior → mezz → junior)
- **Within priority levels:** Pro rata across same-ranking creditors (except single noteholder prepayments)

---

### **(C) Implications and Recommended Actions**

**Senior Lender Perspective:**

**Key Waterfall Protections:**
1. **Interest paid from principal collections** - no reliance on asset yield (appropriate for inventory)
2. **Mandatory redemption prevents over-leverage** - bi-weekly testing catches BB breaches quickly
3. **Reserve drawdown hierarchy** protects senior interest/principal before mezz interest

**Operational Considerations:**
- **Bi-weekly settlement** (not monthly) - more frequent than typical ABS, requires robust reporting/cash management
- **Daily BB calculation** for revolving drawdowns - operationally intensive but provides real-time visibility
- **Monthly interest payments** standard cadence

**Risks to Waterfall:**
1. **If AUTO1 defaults during revolving period** - no new vehicle sales, only liquidation of existing inventory:
   - Cash margin benefit lost (no new purchases at discount)
   - Reserves must cover interest until liquidation complete
   - Sequential amortisation begins immediately
2. **BUS activation disruption** - if Autorola takes 30-60 days to operationalise, collections may slow:
   - Reserves provide buffer
   - Target liquidation: 10 BD from BUS activation per servicing agreement
3. **Currency risk (Sweden)** - 5.6% of pool in SEK, converted to EUR at purchase date:
   - Resale in EUR creates FX risk if SEK strengthens
   - Capped at 10% concentration limit

**Client/Investor Presentation - Waterfall Summary:**

**Pre-Amortisation (Normal Operations):**
- Senior interest paid monthly from collections (priority 6)
- Excess cash used to replenish reserves, then mandatory redemption to BB targets (priorities 7-9)
- Bi-weekly rebalancing ensures notes never exceed BB limits

**Post-Amortisation (Triggered Event):**
- Senior interest elevated to priority 4
- Sequential pay: senior principal → mezz interest → mezz principal
- Reserves fully available to support senior claims
- Target timeline: 18 months to full amortisation

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Model waterfall scenarios:** Simulate AUTO1 default at different time points, assess adequacy of reserves + collateral to meet senior claims
- **Request Settlement Reports:** Obtain bi-weekly settlement reports (not just monthly) for 3-6 months to verify waterfall calculations and BB compliance mechanics
- **Verify Account Bank arrangements:** Confirm Deutsche Bank (issuer accounts) and SEB (Swedish collections) replacement triggers operational (BBB rating floors)

---

## **PART 5: REVOLVING CRITERIA & PORTFOLIO LIMITS**

### **(A) Facts and Inputs**

**Revolving Period Structure:**
- **Initial term:** 24 months from closing (Jan 2021 → Jan 2023)
- **Extension option:** Additional 12 months with noteholder consent (total 36 months possible)
- **During revolving period:** CarCos can purchase new vehicles daily by drawing on loans (subject to BB capacity)
- **Availability period termination events:** Trigger early amortisation (see Part 3)

**Revolving Mechanics:**
- **Daily BB calculation** determines available capacity for new purchases
- **Bi-weekly settlement testing** (3 BD before Settlement Date) verifies compliance
- **Net borrowing base** = Gross BB − ineligible vehicles − concentration excess − dilutions − market value adjustments
- **Drawdown limits:**
  - Senior: up to 80% of Net BB (max EUR 400m committed at closing; **now EUR 875m per 2025 financials**)
  - Mezzanine: up to 10% of Net BB (max EUR 50m committed at closing)
  - Junior: residual (no BB limit)

**Portfolio Limits During Revolving (Replenishment Conditions - see Part 2 for full table):**

**Critical Revolving Constraints:**
1. **Negative margin countries:** Max 10% of portfolio
2. **Average days in inventory:** Max 70 days (WA across portfolio)
3. **Days 180-300 bucket:** Max 5% of portfolio
4. **Italian vehicles:** Max 20% (interim period only - now wound down)
5. **Swedish vehicles:** Max 10%
6. **Electric vehicles:** Max 5%
7. **Remarketing vehicles (on-hand):** Max 5%

**Current Portfolio Composition (H1 2025 per Audit):**

**DoI Buckets (March 2025):**
- 0-70 days: 81.8% of vehicles, 77.0% of value
- 71-90 days: 5.9% of vehicles, 6.9% of value
- 91-140 days: 8.6% of vehicles, 10.8% of value
- 141-170 days: 2.0% of vehicles, 2.9% of value
- 171-300 days: 1.6% of vehicles, 2.4% of value

**Key Metrics:**
- **Average DoI:** Well below 70-day limit (77-82% in 0-70 bucket)
- **Total portfolio value:** EUR 723.8m (March 2025)
- **Total vehicles:** ~71k units

---

### **(B) Observations and Reasoning**

**Revolving Period Design:**
- **24-month initial term balances:**
  - (+) Operational flexibility for AUTO1 to scale business
  - (−) Pool migration risk - composition can shift materially over 2 years
  - Mitigation: Tight eligibility + replenishment conditions + early amortisation triggers

**Portfolio Limit Framework - Observations:**
1. **10% cap on negative margin countries is the binding constraint** - prevents adverse selection:
   - If AUTO1 experiences margin pressure in a geography (e.g. regulatory changes, competition), cannot load facility with loss-making vehicles
   - Tested bi-weekly on 3-month rolling average
2. **70-day WA DoI limit enforces turnover discipline:**
   - Current portfolio 81.8% in 0-70 day bucket = **substantial compliance headroom**
   - AUTO1's model (fast-turn wholesale) naturally aligns with limit
3. **5% cap on 180-300 day bucket** catches stale inventory early:
   - Current 1.6% = **well within limit**
   - Vehicles approaching 300 days drop to ineligible automatically
4. **Electric vehicle 5% cap** addresses residual value/demand uncertainty:
   - Current 1% = **headroom available but not utilised**
   - Reflects AUTO1's focus on mainstream diesel/petrol (95% of pool)

**Revolving vs. Static Pool Risk:**
- **Dynamic pool creates uncertainty** for investors - cannot rely on closing pool characteristics
- **Mitigation via:**
  - Eligibility criteria (300-day max, ownership, insurance, security)
  - Concentration limits (geography, brand, age, price, type)
  - Replenishment conditions (prevents build-up of negative margin/stale inventory)
  - **Stop-purchase trigger** (5% cash margin) - if profitability deteriorates, revolving stops automatically

---

### **(C) Implications and Recommended Actions**

**Senior Lender Assessment:**

**Revolving Structure - Acceptable Subject To:**
1. **Tight monitoring of revolving period compliance:**
   - Bi-weekly BBR review (not just monthly)
   - Track portfolio composition trends (geography, DoI, margin by country)
   - Flag any concentration approaching limits
2. **Extension risk:** If noteholders consent to 12-month extension:
   - Increases pool migration/composition uncertainty
   - Extends senior tenor (maturity moves out 12 months)
   - Recommendation: **Consent conditional on:** (i) no trigger breaches, (ii) AUTO1 credit profile stable, (iii) portfolio metrics within comfortable bounds

**Red Flags - Revolving Period:**
1. **Rising average DoI** trending toward 70-day limit
2. **Build-up in 180-300 day bucket** above 3% (early warning before 5% limit)
3. **Any country showing negative 3m cash margin** approaching 10% limit
4. **Geographic concentration shift** - e.g. if Germany exposure drops materially and Italian/other exposure rises (may signal operational issues in core market)

**Current Performance - Green Lights:**
- Portfolio composition healthy (81.8% in 0-70 DoI bucket)
- Cash margin 13.67-14.06% vs. 5% trigger = substantial headroom
- All concentration limits comfortable
- No evidence of negative margin countries in pool

**Investor Explanation - Revolving Structure:**

"The 24-month revolving period allows AUTO1 to dynamically manage inventory while the facility scales with the business. Senior and mezzanine notes only finance eligible vehicles that meet strict criteria and are subject to portfolio-wide concentration limits. The borrowing base mechanism recalculates daily, and bi-weekly settlement testing ensures compliance. If portfolio quality deteriorates - measured by cash trading margin falling below 5%, dilution exceeding thresholds, or average holding period approaching 70 days - the revolving period terminates automatically and the notes begin sequential amortisation. This structure balances operational flexibility with investor protection through real-time monitoring and embedded early amortisation triggers."

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Obtain BBR time series** (12-24 months) - analyse trends in DoI, geography, cash margin, concentration metrics
2. **Request pool stratification** - detailed breakdown by purchase country, brand, age, fuel type, price band
3. **Assess extension likelihood:** Has transaction been extended beyond initial 24 months? If so, on what terms and conditions?
4. **Model revolving risk:** Stress-test scenarios where portfolio shifts to maximum allowed limits (70 days DoI, 10% negative margin countries, 20% Italy, etc.) - assess impact on loss severity

## **PART 6: KEY DEFINITIONS & LEGAL PROVISIONS** 

### **(A) Critical Defined Terms - Extracted with Document References**

**Advance Rate / Borrowing Base:**
- **Senior Advance Rate:** 80% (max senior notes as % of Net Borrowing Base)
  - *Document:* Master Definitions and Common Terms Agreement
  - *Amendment protection:* Requires ALL noteholder consent (Trust Agreement Clause 21.3(a))
  
- **Mezzanine Advance Rate:** 10% (max mezzanine notes as % of Net Borrowing Base after senior)
  - *Document:* Master Definitions and Common Terms Agreement
  - *Amendment protection:* Requires ALL noteholder consent (Trust Agreement Clause 21.3(a))

- **Net Borrowing Base:** Gross Borrowing Base less:
  - Ineligible vehicles
  - Concentration excess amounts
  - Dilutions (used vouchers, closed claims)
  - Market value adjustments (Vehicle Value Adjustment Factor applied by DoI bucket)

**Vehicle Value Adjustment Factor (Market Value Haircut for Ageing):**
| **Days in Inventory** | **Adjustment Factor** |
|---|---|
| 0-70 days | 98.00% |
| 71-90 days | 100.00% |
| 91-140 days | 110.00% |
| 141-170 days | 115.00% |
| +171 days | 120.00% |

*Interpretation:* **Inverse haircut** - vehicles held longer count at HIGHER value in BB calculation (e.g. 171+ days vehicle with EUR 10k purchase price counts as EUR 12k in BB). This appears counterintuitive (older vehicles worth less, not more). **Verify interpretation - may be error in document imaging or arithmetic.**

**Cash Trading Margin (Critical Performance Metric):**
- *Definition:* 
  - For Autohero retail sales: (Sale price to retail customer) − (Purchase price paid by CarCo) − (Refurbishment investments)
  - For other sales: (Sale price + Used Vouchers) − (Purchase price + Auction service fee + Refurbishment investments)
- *Trigger:* 3-month rolling average <5% → Stop Purchase Event → Early Amortisation
- *Document:* Master Definitions and Common Terms Agreement
  - Section references embedded in definition (calculation methodology)

**Dilution Metrics:**
- **Used Vouchers:** Credits/discounts applied against sale price (max 0.90% 3m rolling avg)
- **Closed Claims:** Payments to purchasers for defects/incorrect descriptions (max 2.00% 3m rolling avg)
- *Document:* Master Definitions and Common Terms Agreement
- *Testing:* Bi-weekly on Settlement Test Date (3 BD before Settlement Date)
- *Consequence:* Breach (uncured) → Issuer Early Amortisation Event → Revolving stops

**Eligible Vehicle (Consolidated Definition):**
A vehicle that:
1. Is fully owned by CarCo NL or CarCo IT
2. For which CarCo has paid full purchase price (or will pay same day as related loan proceeds received)
3. Has been held in inventory for maximum 300 days
4. Is not subject to any claim, reclamation rights, or retention of title
5. Is covered by satisfactory vehicle insurance
6. Has physical location in eligible jurisdiction (DE, FR, ES, IT, NL, BE, AT, PL, SE)
7. Owned by CarCo NL, CarCo IT, or other Group custodian agents
8. Has not been bought from sanctioned person
9. Is subject to first-ranking security interest (except when in transit or located in Italy or Sweden)
10. Purchase consistent with customary AUTO1 practices
- *Document:* Multiple (Eligibility criteria scattered across Master Definitions, Servicing Agreement, Scope Rating Report)
- *Testing:* Daily (for BB calculation) and bi-weekly (for Settlement Report)

**Early Amortisation Event vs. Enforcement Event:**

**Early Amortisation Events (Issuer):** *(Master Definitions Clause 6.1)*
- BB shortfall (notes > BB value, uncured 5 BD)
- Cash trading margin <5% (3m rolling avg)
- Dilution breach (vouchers >0.90% or claims >2.00%, 3m rolling avg)
- CarCo Early Amortisation Event occurs
- Issuer security invalidity (uncured 15 BD)
- Issuer material breach (uncured 15 BD)
- Issuer misrepresentation (uncured 10 BD)
- Servicer insolvency event
- BUS activation
- CarCo discontinues business / missed payment (uncured 10 BD)
- *Consequence:* Revolving period terminates → Amortisation period begins → Sequential pay (senior → mezz) over 18 months

**Enforcement Events (CarCo & Issuer):** *(Loan Agreements Clause 20.2; Note Terms Clause 9)*
- **CarCo Enforcement Event:**
  - CarCo insolvency event; **OR**
  - Missed payment on CarCo loans (interest/principal/mandatory prepayment) uncured 15 BD
  - *Consequence:* Security Trustee delivers CarCo Enforcement Notice → BUS activated → Collection/enforcement of CarCo Charged Property
  
- **Issuer Enforcement Event:**
  - Non-payment on notes (pre-maturity) per specified grace periods; **OR**
  - Non-payment on maturity date; **OR**
  - Issuer insolvency; **OR**
  - Material breach/security invalidity uncured
  - *Consequence:* Security Trustee delivers Issuer Enforcement Notice → Collection/enforcement of Issuer Charged Property → Post-Enforcement waterfall applies

### **(B) Observations on Legal Structure**

**Key Legal Features:**
1. **Bankruptcy Remoteness:**
   - Issuer: 100% owned by Stichting (orphan entity), no shareholders
   - CarCos: 100% owned by AUTO1 but structured as non-consolidated SPVs
   - Legal opinions provided on non-consolidation with AUTO1 insolvency estate
   - *Document:* Scope Rating Report Section 8.1, Trust Agreement

2. **Security Structure:**
   - **CarCo Charged Property:** Vehicles, sales proceeds, intercompany loans, collection accounts
   - **Issuer Charged Property:** CarCo loans, issuer accounts (transaction, reserves), certain rights under transaction docs
   - **First-ranking** security (except Italy/Sweden/in-transit vehicles)
   - *Perfection:* Complex multi-jurisdictional (9 countries) - **requires local law opinions for each**

3. **True Sale Analysis:**
   - Vehicles purchased by CarCos from AUTO1 subsidiaries
   - **Intercompany loans netted** (no physical cash transfer) - mitigates commingling risk
   - Legal transfer occurs when: (i) full purchase price paid, (ii) title perfected, (iii) vehicle not subject to retention of title
   - *Risk:* Retention of title claims from original sellers (if AUTO1 subsidiaries buy on retention terms and fail to perfect)

**Amendment Restrictions (Trust Agreement Clause 21.3):**
Requires **ALL noteholder consent** to amend:
- Senior/Mezzanine Advance Rate definitions
- Issuer Priority of Payments (Pre or Post Amortisation/Enforcement)
- Early Amortisation Events
- CarCo Early Amortisation Events
- CarCo Events of Default
- *Implication:* Core structural terms locked - protects senior noteholders from adverse amendments

---

### **(C) Implications for Transaction Execution & Monitoring**

**Legal Diligence - Critical Workstreams:**

1. **Security Perfection Verification:**
   - Confirm first-ranking security perfected in all 9 jurisdictions (particularly IT, SE where exceptions apply)
   - Review local law opinions (Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Sweden)
   - Verify UCC filings (if applicable) and local registry filings (vehicles, pledges)
   - **Red flag:** Any jurisdiction where perfection delayed or incomplete

2. **True Sale / Non-Consolidation:**
   - Review legal opinions on:
     - Issuer bankruptcy remoteness (Dutch law)
     - CarCo NL bankruptcy remoteness (Dutch law)
     - CarCo IT bankruptcy remoteness (Italian law - **now wound down**)
     - Non-consolidation of issuer/CarCos with AUTO1 estate
   - Confirm independent directors on CarCo/Issuer boards (if required)
   - Verify no guarantees from AUTO1 parent to issuer/CarCos (maintains non-recourse structure)

3. **Retention of Title Risk:**
   - **Critical:** Eligibility criteria require vehicles "not subject to...retention of title"
   - **Risk:** If AUTO1 subsidiaries purchase vehicles from dealers/consumers on retention terms:
     - Original seller retains title until full payment
     - If AUTO1 subsidiary fails to pay, seller can reclaim vehicle
     - CarCo security interest may be subordinated or invalid
   - **Mitigation:** Verify AUTO1 purchase procedures ensure either: (i) immediate payment, or (ii) retention of title released before vehicle included in BB
   - **Operating Audit finding:** 161 instances where purchase contract date ≠ BB inclusion date - **explained by this timing (vehicle enters BB only when fully paid and title perfected)**

4. **Counterparty Replacement Triggers:**
   - **Account banks:** Deutsche Bank (issuer accounts, CarCo collection), SEB (Swedish collection)
     - Replacement trigger: Loss of **BBB** rating (S&P)
     - Replacement timeline: **15 Business Days** (21 calendar days)
     - *Compliance with Scope counterparty criteria:* Yes (30 calendar day threshold for A-rated debt, BB/S-3 floor)
   - **Servicer (AUTO1):** Replacement on insolvency, material breach (uncured 15 BD), unlawful performance
   - **BUS (Autorola):** Pre-appointed; activates on servicer termination or CarCo Enforcement Event
     - Target liquidation: **10 Business Days** from activation
     - *Assessment:* "Hot" back-up servicer (Scope rating report) - significant advance integration

5. **Jurisdiction-Specific Risks:**
   - **Italy:** Originally part of interim period (CarCo IT) - now wound down (closed June 2021)
   - **Sweden:** Non-euro currency (SEK) creates FX risk; capped at 10% concentration
   - **Poland:** May have different insolvency/perfection regimes - verify local law opinion
   - **All jurisdictions:** VAT treatment, trade tax implications (covered by Trade Tax Reserve)

**Key Terms for Client Presentation:**

**Structural Protections:**
- "The transaction is structured with bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicles (issuer and CarCos) that are legally isolated from AUTO1's insolvency risk. Security interests in the vehicle collateral are first-ranking across all jurisdictions (subject to limited exceptions for in-transit vehicles). The issuer and CarCos are obligated only to the noteholders and transaction parties - no recourse to AUTO1 parent company except for AUTO1's voluntary support obligations while solvent."

**Amendment Protections:**
- "Core economic terms - including the 80% senior advance rate, 10% mezzanine advance rate, priority of payments, and early amortisation triggers - cannot be amended without the consent of ALL noteholders, not just a majority. This protects senior noteholders from adverse restructurings."

**Legal Risk Mitigations:**
- "The transaction operates across nine European jurisdictions with diverging legal regimes. Legal opinions have been obtained in each jurisdiction confirming the validity and enforceability of the security interests, the true sale of vehicles to the CarCos, and the bankruptcy remoteness of the issuer and CarCos. The structure includes daily cash sweeps and intercompany loan netting to eliminate cash commingling risk."

---

## **SUMMARY: TRANSACTION ASSESSMENT**

### **(A) Overall Structure**

**Auto1 Funding B.V. Inventory ABS (January 2021 closing) - Up to EUR 500m two-tier financing structure:**
- Senior (A-sf, up to EUR 400m, 1M Euribor +175bps, 80% advance rate, 20% minimum subordination)
- Mezzanine (BBB-sf, up to EUR 50m, 1M Euribor +450bps, 10% advance rate, 10% minimum subordination)
- Junior (NR, up to EUR 50m, 5.0% fixed, residual)
- Collateral: Used vehicle inventory across 9 European jurisdictions
- Revolving: 24 months (extendable 12 months) → Amortisation: 18 months → Maturity: July 2024

### **(B) Strengths**

1. **Borrowing base discipline** - Daily BB calculation, bi-weekly settlement testing, automatic deleveraging if notes exceed BB value
2. **Multiple CE layers** - Subordination (20%/10% floors) + liquidity reserves (senior ~6mo, mezz ~4mo) + positive cash margin + AUTO1 recourse
3. **Fast collateral turnover** - 48-day average DoI at closing; 81.8% in 0-70 day bucket (March 2025) - limits market value erosion
4. **Tight eligibility** - 300-day max DoI, retention of title exclusion, insurance requirement, first-ranking security
5. **Concentration limits** - 10% cap on negative margin countries, 70-day WA DoI limit, brand/geography diversification
6. **Combined P&I waterfall** - Principal collections can pay interest (appropriate for zero-yield inventory collateral)
7. **Early amortisation triggers** - 5% cash margin stop-purchase, dilution caps, BB breach - catches distress early
8. **Bankruptcy remote structure** - Issuer/CarCos legally isolated from AUTO1; intercompany netting eliminates commingling

### **(C) Risks**

1. **No asset yield** - All CE from OC, reserves, and AUTO1 support (not cash flow from collateral)
2. **Interest rate exposure** - Notes pay floating (1M Euribor), assets generate no indexed return; mitigated by reserves + AUTO1 obligation
3. **Revolving period uncertainty** - 24-month dynamic pool creates composition migration risk (mitigated by eligibility/replenishment conditions)
4. **Complex multi-jurisdictional structure** - 9 countries, varying insolvency/perfection regimes, operational coordination risk
5. **AUTO1 recourse dependency** - If AUTO1 defaults, only resources are collateral + reserves; AUTO1 solvency critical
6. **Reserve sizing** - Senior ~6mo, mezz ~4mo adequate for fast turnover but vulnerable if BUS liquidation extends
7. **Retention of title risk** - If AUTO1 subsidiaries buy vehicles with retention clauses and fail to perfect, security compromised

### **(D) Current Performance (Q1 2025)**

**Green Lights:**
- Cash trading margin: 13.67-14.06% (vs. 5% trigger = ~900bps headroom)
- Dilution: 0.10-1.01% (vs. 0.90%/2.00% triggers = substantial headroom)
- DoI profile: 81.8% in 0-70 day bucket (vs. 70-day WA limit = very comfortable)
- No trigger breaches
- 99% documentation success rate (operational audit)

**Monitoring Points:**
- Facility has been **significantly upsized** since 2021 closing (EUR 875m current senior commitment vs. EUR 400m original)
- Additional facilities added (consumer loan ABS, merchant financing ABS, public ABS notes)
- Total ABS utilisation EUR 1.3bn (June 2025) across multiple facilities

### **(E) Senior Lender Recommended Actions**

**Immediate:**
1. Obtain latest BBRs (post-Q1 2025) + Settlement Reports (bi-weekly) for 3-6 months
2. Request pool stratification by country, DoI, brand, cash margin trends
3. Verify current facility terms - confirm upsize, any structural changes, current utilisation vs. committed
4. Review latest AUTO1 financial statements (H1 2025 results show inventory ABS utilisation EUR 715m vs. EUR 600m Dec 2024)

**Ongoing Monitoring:**
1. **Monthly:** BBR review (cash margin, dilution, DoI ageing, BB coverage ratios)
2. **Quarterly:** Portfolio deep dive (concentration trends, AUTO1 solvency assessment, reserve adequacy)
3. **Event-driven:** Immediate escalation if: (i) cash margin <7% (early warning), (ii) any trigger cure period, (iii) servicer/BUS issues

**Due Diligence (if new origination/underwriting):**
1. Legal opinions - bankruptcy remoteness, security perfection (all 9 jurisdictions), true sale
2. Model loss scenarios - AUTO1 default at various time points, rating-conditional collateral haircuts, assess senior recovery
3. Stress reserves - extend liquidation to 12 months, test interest/expense coverage
4. Retention of title audit - verify AUTO1 purchase procedures prevent inclusion of vehicles with title defects
5. Counterparty credit assessment - Deutsche Bank (account bank), SEB (Swedish collections), Autorola (BUS)

---

**Analysis complete. Structure is robust for senior lender participation, subject to ongoing monitoring of revolving portfolio composition, trigger compliance, and AUTO1 credit profile. Borrowing base discipline and multiple CE layers provide substantial protection, though dependency on AUTO1 recourse (while solvent) and zero asset yield create tail risk if AUTO1 defaults during revolving period.**

**Ready for follow-up questions or deeper analysis on specific aspects.**
----------------------------------------------
**PRIORITY 5 WATERFALL ANALYSIS: "JUNIOR VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS + RESERVES"**

Excellent question. This is a **structurally unusual feature** that warrants careful scrutiny. Let me break down the mechanics, rationale, and senior lender risk implications.

---

## **(A) FACTS: WHAT IS PRIORITY 5?**

**Waterfall Position:**
```
Priority 4: Account bank fees
Priority 5: Junior voluntary prepayments + Junior Reserve Proceeds [CONDITIONAL: "only if no senior/mezz shortfalls"]
Priority 6: Senior notes interest
Priority 7: Replenish senior reserve
Priority 8: Senior notes mandatory redemption
```

**Components of Priority 5:**
1. **Voluntary Prepayments:** AUTO1 (as junior noteholder) can voluntarily prepay junior notes
2. **Junior Reserve Proceeds:** Release of excess cash held in junior reserve

**Source:** MDCTA Schedule 4 Priority 5 states:
- *"Proceeds from ineligible vehicle trading to junior noteholders, as long as no senior or mezzanine shortfalls"*
- Also covers voluntary prepayments under Junior Loan Agreement Clause 7.2(b)
- Also covers Junior Reserve Proceeds per MDCTA Clause 2.3(c)(iv)

---

## **(B) ECONOMIC RATIONALE: WHY DOES THIS EXIST?**

**Purpose - Sponsor Cash Management:**

1. **Ineligible Vehicle Proceeds:** 
   - Vehicles that become **ineligible** (exceed 300 days, lose insurance, retention of title issues) drop out of Net Borrowing Base
   - These vehicles still have value and can be sold
   - Proceeds from ineligible vehicle sales go to **juniors** (not seniors/mezz) because seniors/mezz only financed eligible vehicles
   - **Logic:** Senior lenders never financed these vehicles, so proceeds shouldn't go to seniors

2. **Junior Voluntary Prepayment:**
   - AUTO1 (junior holder) may want to **reduce exposure** if transaction is over-collateralized
   - Allows AUTO1 to **recycle capital** into business rather than trap it in the structure
   - **Benefit to seniors:** Keeps AUTO1 liquid and able to honour recourse obligations

3. **Junior Reserve Release:**
   - Junior reserve holds excess cash for junior protection
   - If transaction is performing well and reserve is overfunded, release back to AUTO1
   - **Avoids dead capital** sitting idle in reserve earning minimal return

**Market Precedent:**
- Common in **sponsor-retained junior** structures where sponsor provides recourse support
- Allows sponsor to manage junior position dynamically
- Incentivizes sponsor to keep transaction performing (rewards good performance with cash release)

---

## **(C) RISK ANALYSIS: THE CRITICAL ISSUE**

**The Problem: Priority 5 Sits ABOVE Senior Interest**

**Normal Expectation:**
```
SAFE STRUCTURE:
1. Taxes/fees
2. Transaction expenses
3. Senior interest ← Pay seniors first
4. Senior reserve ← Then protect liquidity
5. Junior prepayments ← Then pay juniors if excess
```

**Actual Structure:**
```
ACTUAL (AUTO1):
1. Taxes/fees
2. Transaction expenses  
3. Junior prepayments [if no shortfalls] ← Junior gets paid...
4. Senior interest ← ...BEFORE senior interest
5. Senior reserve ← ...and BEFORE senior reserve replenishment
```

**Why This Matters:**

| **Scenario** | **Collections Available** | **Priority 5 Payment** | **Impact on Seniors** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strong performance** | EUR 60m | EUR 5m to juniors | No impact - seniors still paid EUR 55m interest ✓ |
| **Tight liquidity** | EUR 55m | EUR 5m to juniors? | **Seniors get EUR 50m vs EUR 54.6m needed** ✗ |
| **Distress** | EUR 50m | Skipped (shortfall test) | Seniors get full EUR 50m available ✓ |

**The Key Question:** What is the **definition of "no senior/mezz shortfalls"** and **when is it tested**?

---

## **(D) SAFEGUARD ANALYSIS: DOES THE "NO SHORTFALLS" TEST WORK?**

**CRITICAL: The effectiveness of Priority 5 depends entirely on HOW "no shortfalls" is defined.**

**OPTION A: PROSPECTIVE TEST (Protective)**
```
Test: "Are there sufficient funds to pay Priorities 6-9 IN FULL 
       AFTER deducting Priority 5 payment?"

Calculation:
- Collections available: EUR 55m
- Priority 5 proposed: EUR 5m  
- Remaining for P6-9: EUR 50m
- Required for P6-9: EUR 54.6m (senior interest + reserves + mandatory redemption)
- Test result: FAIL (EUR 50m < EUR 54.6m)
- Action: SKIP Priority 5, apply full EUR 55m to senior obligations
```
**Outcome:** Senior lenders fully protected ✓

**OPTION B: RETROSPECTIVE TEST (Dangerous)**
```
Test: "Were there any shortfalls on PRIOR settlement dates?"

Calculation:
- Prior month: No arrears (all paid in full)
- Test result: PASS (no historical shortfalls)
- Action: Pay Priority 5 EUR 5m to juniors
- Remaining: EUR 50m for senior obligations
- Required: EUR 54.6m
- Result: SENIOR SHORTFALL of EUR 4.6m this month
```
**Outcome:** Senior lenders subordinated to junior voluntary prepayments ✗

---

## **(E) CONTRACTUAL LANGUAGE REVIEW**

**What I Found in Documents:**

**From Scope Rating Report (Section 4.7):**
- Priority 2: "Proceeds from ineligible vehicle trading to junior noteholders, **as long as no senior or mezzanine shortfalls**"

**From MDCTA Schedule 4 (Waterfall):**
- Priority 5 language references:
  - Junior Loan Agreement Clause 7.2(b) (Voluntary Prepayment)
  - MDCTA Clause 2.3(c)(iv) (Junior Reserve release conditions)

**CRITICAL GAP:** The documents provided do NOT contain the **precise calculation methodology** for the "no shortfalls" test.

**WHAT SENIOR LENDERS MUST VERIFY:**

1. **Test Timing:** Is it calculated **pro forma** (after deducting P5) or **ex post** (historical only)?

2. **Test Scope:** Does "no shortfalls" mean:
   - Sufficient to pay P6-9 in full? ✓ (protective)
   - No arrears from prior periods? ✗ (insufficient)
   - Sufficient to pay just P6 (senior interest)? ✗ (inadequate - ignores reserves)

3. **Calculation Agent Discretion:** Can the Calculation Agent **refuse** Priority 5 payment if it believes a shortfall would result?

4. **Reserve Inclusion:** Does the test require funding of:
   - Senior reserve replenishment (P7)? (should be YES)
   - Mezzanine reserve replenishment (P13)? (should be YES)
   - Mandatory redemptions (P8-9)? (should be YES)

---

## **(F) SPECIFIC RISKS WITH EUR 1,150M UPSIZE**

**Materiality Increases:**

**Pre-Upsize (EUR 875m):**
- Annual senior interest: EUR 41.6m (at Euribor 3% + 175bps)
- Monthly senior interest: EUR 3.5m
- If Priority 5 pays EUR 2m to juniors when EUR 60m available → 3.3% of collections
- **Low risk:** EUR 2m junior payment unlikely to impair EUR 3.5m senior interest

**Post-Upsize (EUR 1,150m):**
- Annual senior interest: EUR 54.6m (at Euribor 3% + 175bps)
- Monthly senior interest: EUR 4.6m
- If Priority 5 pays EUR 5m to juniors when EUR 60m available → 8.3% of collections
- **HIGHER RISK:** EUR 5m junior payment more material relative to EUR 4.6m senior interest

**Stress Scenario (Post-Upsize):**
```
Assumptions:
- EUR 1,150m drawn
- Cash trading margin falls to 7% (still above 5% trigger)
- Collections slow due to inventory ageing
- Monthly collections: EUR 50m

Waterfall:
P1-4: Taxes/fees/expenses: EUR 2m
P5: Junior voluntary prepayment: EUR 5m [QUESTION: Is this paid?]
P6: Senior interest: EUR 4.6m
P7: Senior reserve replenishment: EUR 1m  
P8: Mandatory redemption: EUR 37.4m (to stay within BB)

Total required (P6-8): EUR 43m
Available after P1-4: EUR 48m

If P5 PAID: EUR 48m - EUR 5m = EUR 43m → EXACT MATCH (no cushion)
If P5 SKIPPED: EUR 48m available → EUR 5m cushion for senior obligations

SENIOR RISK: In tight liquidity, Priority 5 payments could eliminate safety margin
```

---

## **(G) IS THIS COMMENSURATE WITH SENIOR LENDER RISK?**

### **VERDICT: IT DEPENDS**

**ACCEPTABLE IF:**
1. ✓ "No shortfalls" test is **prospective and comprehensive**
   - Tests ability to pay P6-9 in full AFTER P5 payment
   - Includes senior reserve replenishment, not just interest
   - Calculation agent has discretion to refuse payment

2. ✓ **Historical performance shows** Priority 5 correctly skipped in tight months
   - Review 12-24 months of settlement reports
   - Verify P5 = EUR 0 when liquidity tight

3. ✓ **Junior reserve proceeds** are truly excess (not needed for senior protection)
   - Junior reserve is separate from senior/mezz reserves
   - Release only occurs when transaction overcollateralized

4. ✓ **Ineligible vehicle proceeds** rationale is sound
   - Seniors never financed ineligible vehicles (by definition outside Net BB)
   - Therefore proceeds shouldn't go to seniors (no loss of security)

**UNACCEPTABLE IF:**
1. ✗ Test is retrospective only (checks historical arrears, not current sufficiency)
2. ✗ Test excludes reserve replenishment requirements
3. ✗ Calculation agent mechanically pays P5 without assessing senior impact
4. ✗ Historical settlement reports show P5 paid when liquidity was tight

---

## **(H) RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR SENIOR LENDERS**

### **IMMEDIATE (Pre-7th Amendment Consent):**

**1. Obtain and Review Exact Contractual Language:**
```
REQUEST FROM AUTO1/COUNSEL:
□ Junior Loan Agreement Clause 7.2(b) (Voluntary Prepayment provisions)
□ MDCTA Clause 2.3(c)(iv) (Junior Reserve release conditions)  
□ MDCTA Schedule 4 Priority 5 detailed language (not summary)
□ Calculation Agent procedures for "no shortfalls" test
```

**2. Request Historical Settlement Reports (12-24 months):**
```
ANALYZE:
□ How often was Priority 5 payment > EUR 0?
□ What were collections levels when P5 paid?
□ Was P5 ever skipped? Under what conditions?
□ Calculate P5 as % of collections in each month
□ Identify tightest liquidity months - was P5 correctly skipped?
```

**3. Verify Test Calculation:**
```
OBTAIN FROM CALCULATION AGENT:
□ Written description of "no shortfalls" test methodology
□ Worked example showing calculation steps
□ Confirmation test is PRO FORMA (after P5 deduction)
□ Confirmation test covers P6-9 (interest + reserves + mandatory redemption)
```

**4. Model Post-Upsize Impact:**
```
STRESS SCENARIOS:
□ EUR 1,150m drawn, cash margin 7%, collections EUR 50m/month
□ Calculate max Priority 5 payment that doesn't impair P6-9
□ Model Euribor rising to 4-5% (increases P6 senior interest)
□ Assess headroom reduction from EUR 875m → EUR 1,150m
```

**5. Negotiate Amendment Language (If Test Inadequate):**
```
PROPOSED FIX:
Add to 7th Amendment:

"Priority 5 payments shall only be made if the Calculation Agent 
determines, in its sole discretion, that funds available (after 
deducting such Priority 5 payment) are sufficient to pay in full all 
amounts due under Priorities 6 through 9 on such Settlement Date, 
including:
  (i) senior notes interest and fees in full;
  (ii) required senior reserve amount in full;
  (iii) mezzanine notes interest in full;
  (iv) required mezzanine reserve amount in full;
  (v) mandatory redemptions required by borrowing base compliance."
```

### **NEGOTIATING POSITION:**

**IF AUTO1/ARRANGERS RESIST:**

**Option A: Request Priority Swap**
- Move Priority 5 to **after** Priority 13 (mezz reserve replenishment)
- Rationale: "Junior voluntary prepayments should only occur after all senior/mezz obligations MET, not merely 'no shortfall expected'"

**Option B: Require Calculation Agent Sign-Off**
- "Priority 5 payment requires prior written approval of Calculation Agent, acting reasonably, confirming no adverse impact on senior/mezz positions"

**Option C: Cap Priority 5**
- "Priority 5 payments limited to [5%] of collections on any Settlement Date"
- Prevents large junior distributions in tight liquidity

**Option D: Clarify Ineligible Vehicle Proceeds Only**
- "Priority 5 limited to proceeds from ineligible vehicle sales only (not voluntary prepayments from other sources)"
- Aligns with economic rationale (ineligibles weren't financed by seniors)

---

## **(I) PRACTICAL ASSESSMENT: HOW MATERIAL IS THIS RISK?**

**Mitigating Factors (Why It May Be Acceptable):**

1. **AUTO1's Incentive Alignment:**
   - AUTO1 is junior holder AND provides recourse support
   - Taking Priority 5 payment that impairs seniors would trigger own support obligation
   - **Self-correcting:** AUTO1 unlikely to voluntarily prepay juniors if it creates senior shortfall it must cover

2. **5% Cash Margin Trigger:**
   - If collections deteriorate materially, **stop-purchase trigger** (5% cash margin) terminates revolving
   - Transaction enters amortisation before liquidity becomes critically tight
   - Priority 5 likely immaterial in early amortisation (collections focused on P6-9)

3. **Historical Performance:**
   - Cash margin currently 13-14% (nearly 3x the 5% trigger)
   - Strong cushion suggests Priority 5 payments haven't historically stressed the structure
   - 2025 Operating Audit showed no compliance issues (implies waterfall functioning correctly)

4. **Combined P&I Waterfall:**
   - All collections (principal + interest from vehicles) flow through one waterfall
   - **Large pool of funds** (EUR 1.97bn revenue H1 2025 / 6 months = EUR 328m/month)
   - Priority 5 payments (likely EUR 2-5m) are **<2% of monthly collections**
   - Immaterial unless collections collapse (in which case 5% trigger stops it)

**Aggravating Factors (Why It Requires Vigilance):**

1. **Upsize Magnifies Risk:**
   - EUR 54.6m annual senior interest (post-upsize) vs EUR 41.6m (current)
   - Priority 5 becomes more material as % of required senior obligations

2. **Rising Rate Environment:**
   - 1M Euribor currently ~3.7% (October 2024)
   - Senior interest is floating (Euribor + 175bps)
   - If Euribor → 5%, senior interest = 6.75% = EUR 77.6m annually
   - **Interest cost growth without corresponding collection growth** squeezes liquidity

3. **Opacity of Test:**
   - Public documents don't clearly define "no shortfalls" calculation
   - Reliance on Calculation Agent discretion (potential conflicts if Auto1-appointed)

---

## **(J) FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

### **CONCLUSION:**

**Priority 5 is STRUCTURALLY UNUSUAL but MAY BE ACCEPTABLE** if:
1. Contractual test is properly drafted (prospective + comprehensive)
2. Historical evidence shows it functions correctly
3. Immateriality confirmed (Priority 5 typically <2-3% of collections)

**HOWEVER:** This is a **LEGITIMATE CONCERN** that warrants:

### **RISK RATING: MEDIUM (manageable with proper safeguards)**

### **ACTION REQUIRED BEFORE 7TH AMENDMENT CONSENT:**

| **Priority** | **Action** | **Accept 7th Amendment If** |
|---|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** | Obtain Priority 5 contractual language + Calculation Agent procedures | Test is prospective + comprehensive |
| **CRITICAL** | Review 12 months settlement reports | Priority 5 skipped when liquidity tight OR consistently <2% collections |
| **HIGH** | Model post-upsize Priority 5 impact | Priority 5 max payment <5% of required senior obligations |
| **MEDIUM** | Negotiate amendment clarification if test inadequate | AUTO1 agrees to clarify test language |
| **NICE TO HAVE** | Request Calculation Agent independent certification | Independent party confirms test methodology sound |

### **NEGOTIATING STANCE:**

**ACCEPTABLE:**
- Priority 5 remains in current form IF satisfactory evidence provided that test works correctly

**PREFERRED:**
- Add explicit language to 7th Amendment clarifying "no shortfalls" = pro forma sufficiency for P6-13

**WALK-AWAY:**
- If Priority 5 test is retrospective only OR no historical evidence of correct operation → **REJECT 7th Amendment** or demand waterfall amendment

---

**BOTTOM LINE:** Priority 5 is **economically defensible** (ineligible vehicle proceeds, sponsor cash management) but **structurally risky** (sits above senior interest). **Acceptable with robust safeguards; unacceptable without them.** This is exactly the type of technical detail that separates a disciplined senior lender from one who gets surprised in stress scenarios.

**Your question demonstrates excellent credit judgment - this IS a point that requires verification before consent.**
